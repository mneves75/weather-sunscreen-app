## 📱 Screens

### Weather Screen

Displays current weather conditions including temperature, description, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and visibility with real-time updates.

### UV Index Screen

Shows current UV index with safety level, peak time predictions, and personalized sunscreen recommendations based on current conditions.

### Forecast Screen

Provides 7-day weather forecast with daily UV index predictions and precipitation chances (coming soon).

### Profile Screen

User preferences, settings, and app information including temperature units, skin type, and notification preferences.

## ⚡ Native Modules

### Weather Native Module

Custom native implementations for:

- **Location Services**: High-accuracy GPS location with CoreLocation (iOS) and LocationManager (Android)
- **Weather Data**: Integration with platform-specific weather APIs
- **UV Index**: Real-time UV measurements with solar position calculations
- **Background Processing**: Efficient data fetching with proper timeout handling

**Platform Support:**

- **iOS 16+**: Uses WeatherKit framework and CoreLocation for native performance
- **Android API 29+**: Custom Java implementation with modern Android APIs
- **Web**: Graceful fallback to Expo services with mock data

### Important Notes for Expo SDK 54

- WeatherKit requires enabling the WeatherKit capability for your bundle identifier in the Apple Developer portal. If it’s not enabled or unavailable at runtime, the app automatically falls back to service-based weather and safe mock data, so the UX remains intact.
- Expo Go does not include custom native modules. To use the native WeatherKit bridge or the Liquid Glass native module, run a Development Build (`expo run:ios` / `expo run:android`) or build with EAS. The app gracefully falls back to pure JS/Expo implementations when the native modules aren’t present.

## 🛠️ Development

### Common Commands

```bash
# Development
npm start                    # Start Expo development server
npm run ios                  # Build and run iOS
npm run android             # Build and run Android (with Java 17)
npm run web                 # Start web development

# Version management
npm run sync-versions       # Sync all versions to CHANGELOG.md
npm run sync-versions:dry   # Preview version changes

# Troubleshooting
npm run fix-pods           # Fix CocoaPods issues
npm run clean-ios          # Quick iOS cleanup
```

### Environment Setup

## 📦 Building and Deployment

### Development Builds

```bash
# iOS development build
npx eas build --platform ios --profile development

# Android development build
npx eas build --platform android --profile development
```

### Production Builds

# iOS App Store
npx eas build --platform ios --profile production

# Android Play Store
npx eas build --platform android --profile production
```

### App Store Submission

2. Update app icons and splash screens
3. Submit via EAS Submit or manually through store consoles

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**iOS Build Failures:**

```bash
npm run fix-pods              # Fix CocoaPods issues
npm run clean-ios            # Clean build artifacts
```

**Location Permission Issues:**

- Check app.json permissions configuration
- Verify platform-specific permission requests
- Test permission flow in app settings

**Weather Data Not Loading:**

- Check internet connectivity
- Verify API endpoints in configuration
- Review native module error logs

**Performance Issues:**

- Clear app cache and restart
- Check for location service conflicts
- Verify memory usage in development tools

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging by setting `__DEV__` flag:

- Native module operations are logged with detailed error messages
- Weather service calls include timing and success/failure status
- Location requests show accuracy and source information
