## CRITICAL: Issues in Recent Implementations

### 1. **Inflight Promise Never Cleared on Rejection** 🔴 CRITICAL
**File**: `modules/weather-native-module/index.ts:172-187`
**Problem**:
```typescript
this._inflightLocationPromise = (async () => {
  try {
    const loc = await nativeModule.getCurrentLocation();
    // ... validation ...
    return loc;
  } finally {
    // Clear inflight promise after completion
    this._inflightLocationPromise = null;
  }
})();
```

**BUG**: If the promise is awaited by multiple callers and one of them catches the error, the promise is cleared. But if the promise itself throws, it's cleared in `finally`. This is CORRECT! But there's a race condition:

If a **second** call comes in WHILE the first is still pending but BEFORE it's cleared, both will use the same promise. If the first fails and clears it, the second caller gets a rejected promise. But if a THIRD call comes RIGHT after the promise is cleared, it will create a NEW promise.

**Race Condition Window**: Between promise rejection and `finally` execution.

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Rare race condition under high concurrency
**Fix Needed**: Use a lock or atomic check-and-set pattern

---

### 2. **Cache Cleanup During Active Writes** 🔴 CRITICAL
**File**: `src/services/openMeteoService.ts:73-101`
**Problem**:
```typescript
private static cleanExpiredEntries(): void {
  const now = Date.now();

  // Clean forecast cache
  for (const [key, value] of this.forecastCache.entries()) {
    if (now - value.timestamp > this.CACHE_DURATION) {
      this.forecastCache.delete(key);
    }
  }
}
```

**BUG**: `cleanExpiredEntries()` iterates over `forecastCache` and deletes entries. If another thread/async context is simultaneously writing to the cache (line 156-159), you could get:
1. Iterator invalidation (JavaScript is single-threaded, so safe)
2. But: Reading a cache entry that's being deleted by cleanup
3. Or: Deleting an entry that was just refreshed

**Impact**: LOW-MEDIUM - JavaScript's single-threaded nature prevents corruption, but logic bugs possible
**Fix Needed**: Check timestamp again before delete, or use write locks

---

### 3. **isMountedRef Never Initialized to true on First Render** 🟠 HIGH
**File**: `src/context/WeatherContext.tsx:49-60`
**Problem**:
```typescript
const isMountedRef = useRef(true);

useEffect(() => {
  isMountedRef.current = true;  // ← Redundant! Already true
  return () => {
    isMountedRef.current = false;
    if (locationUpdateTimer.current) {
      clearTimeout(locationUpdateTimer.current);
      locationUpdateTimer.current = null;
    }
  };
}, []);
```

**NOT A BUG**: `useRef(true)` initializes it correctly. The `useEffect` line is redundant but harmless. However, this is confusing code.

**Impact**: LOW - Confusing but functionally correct
**Recommendation**: Remove redundant line for clarity

---

### 4. **Constants Import Missing in Native Module** 🟠 HIGH
**File**: `modules/weather-native-module/index.ts:1-4`
**Problem**: Constants imported but **only LIMITS imported from native module**, not TIMINGS.

Let me verify...

```typescript
import { TIMINGS, LIMITS } from '../../src/constants/timings';
```

WAIT - this IS imported. But the import path crosses from `modules/` to `src/`. This creates a **dependency** from native module to app constants. Is this intentional?

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Coupling between native module and app layer
**Design Question**: Should native module have its own constants?

---

### 5. **Temperature Parity Check Doubles API Calls** 🟡 MEDIUM-HIGH
**File**: `src/services/weatherService.ts:184-214`
**Problem**:
```typescript
const nativeData = await WeatherNativeService.getWeatherData(
  location.latitude,
  location.longitude,
);
const weatherCode = nativeData.weatherCode ?? 0;
try {
  const comparison = await OpenMeteoService.getCurrentWeather(location);
  parityDelta = nativeData.temperature - comparison.temperature;
  // ... alerting ...
}
```

**PERFORMANCE ISSUE**: Every time native weather is fetched, we ALSO fetch from OpenMeteo for comparison. This **doubles network calls** and **doubles battery usage** for what's essentially a monitoring/QA feature.

**Impact**: HIGH - 2x network calls, 2x battery, 2x data usage
**Fix Needed**: Make parity check configurable or sample-based (10% of requests)

---

### 6. **Error Boundary Doesn't Handle Async Errors** 🟠 HIGH
**File**: `src/components/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx:16-38`
**Problem**: React Error Boundaries only catch errors in:
- Render phase
- Lifecycle methods
- Constructors

They **DO NOT** catch:
- Async errors (Promises, setTimeout, etc.)
- Event handlers
- Errors in useEffect

**Impact**: HIGH - Many errors won't be caught by boundaries
**Fix Needed**: Add global error handler or per-component try-catch

---

## Test Failures Analysis

### Test 1: Concurrent Location Requests (OUTDATED TEST)
**File**: `modules/weather-native-module/__tests__/index.test.ts:302`
```typescript
expect(mockGetCurrentLocation).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(5);
```

**Issue**: Test expects 5 calls for 5 concurrent requests. New deduplication logic should call it ONCE (or 2-3 max with races).

**Verdict**: TEST IS WRONG. Implementation is CORRECT.
**Fix**: Change expectation to `toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)` or `toBeLessThanOrEqual(2)`

---

### Test 2-4: Burst Count Properties (REMOVED CODE)
**File**: `modules/weather-native-module/__tests__/index.test.ts:315-324`
```typescript
expect((WeatherNativeService as any)._burstCount).toBe(0);
expect((WeatherNativeService as any)._burstScheduled).toBe(false);
expect((WeatherNativeService as any)._locationConcurrency).toBe(0);
```

**Issue**: Tests reference properties that were removed in the deduplication refactor.

**Verdict**: TESTS ARE OUTDATED.
**Fix**: Remove these expectations or test new inflight promise pattern

---

### Test 5: HomeScreen ScrollView (REAL BUG?)
**Location**: Needs investigation
**Status**: TBD

---

## Edge Cases in New Implementations

### Edge Case 1: Theme Hydration Timeout Fires After Success
**File**: `src/theme/theme.tsx:48-54`
**Scenario**:
1. Timeout set for 3 seconds
2. Storage responds at 2.9 seconds
3. `setHydrated(true)` called
4. 0.1 seconds later, timeout fires
5. Checks `if (!cancelled && !hydrated)` - hydrated is now true
6. Does nothing

**Verdict**: SAFE - Timeout check includes `!hydrated` guard

---

### Edge Case 2: Multiple Cleanup Calls in Same Interval
**File**: `src/services/openMeteoService.ts:76-79`
```typescript
if (now - this.lastCleanup < this.CLEANUP_INTERVAL) {
  return;
}
this.lastCleanup = now;
```

**Scenario**: Two calls at exactly the same millisecond
**Race**: Both pass the `if` check, both update `lastCleanup`, both iterate cache

**Impact**: LOW - Double cleanup harmless but inefficient
**Fix**: Atomic compare-and-swap or mutex

---

### Edge Case 3: Promise.allSettled with All Rejections
**File**: `src/services/weatherService.ts:89-116`
**Scenario**: Both weather AND UV requests fail
```typescript
const [weatherResult, uvResult] = await Promise.allSettled([...]);

if (weatherResult.status === 'rejected') {
  logger.error('Weather data fetch failed', new Error(weatherResult.reason));
  throw new Error('Unable to fetch weather data');
}
const weatherData = weatherResult.value;

if (uvResult.status === 'rejected') {
  logger.warn('UV data fetch failed, using fallback', { error: uvResult.reason });
  uvData = { /* fallback */ };
} else {
  uvData = uvResult.value;
}
```

**Verdict**: SAFE - Weather rejection throws, UV gets fallback. Correct!

---

### Edge Case 4: Location Update During Unmount
**File**: `src/context/WeatherContext.tsx:141-168`
**Scenario**:
1. `updateLocation()` called
2. Timeout starts (150ms)
3. Component unmounts at 100ms
4. `isMountedRef.current = false` in cleanup
5. Timeout fires at 150ms
6. Checks `if (!isMountedRef.current)` - rejects promise

**Verdict**: SAFE - Mount check prevents state update

---

### Edge Case 5: App Foreground While Native Call Pending
**File**: `modules/weather-native-module/index.ts:22-35`
**Scenario**:
1. Native module call in progress
2. App goes to background
3. App returns to foreground
4. Cache invalidated (module set to null)
5. Pending call completes - uses stale cached module reference

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Pending calls might fail after cache invalidation
**Fix**: Pending calls should complete with their captured module reference

---

### Edge Case 6: Constants Used Before Import
**Impact**: LOW - ES6 modules hoist imports, so safe

---

### Edge Case 7: Parity Check Fails After Native Success
**File**: `src/services/weatherService.ts:184-220`
**Scenario**:
1. Native WeatherKit returns data successfully
2. OpenMeteo comparison call fails (network down)
3. `parityDelta = null`
4. Continue with native data

**Verdict**: SAFE - Comparison failure doesn't affect data flow

---

### Edge Case 8: React Query Retry During Component Unmount
**Impact**: React Query handles this internally - queries are garbage collected

---

## Performance Concerns

### Concern 1: Parity Check Doubles Network Usage
**Severity**: HIGH
**Details**: See Critical Issue #5
**Recommendation**: Sample-based checking (10% of requests)

---

### Concern 2: Cache Cleanup Every 5 Minutes
**File**: `src/services/openMeteoService.ts:67`
```typescript
private static readonly CLEANUP_INTERVAL = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes
```

**Analysis**: Cleanup only runs on cache access, not on timer. So if no requests for an hour, cleanup never runs. This is actually GOOD - lazy cleanup.

**Verdict**: EFFICIENT DESIGN

---

## Architectural Issues Missed in First Audit

### Issue 1: No AbortController for Fetch Requests
**Impact**: MEDIUM
**Details**: Unmounted components can't cancel inflight fetch requests
**Status**: Documented in first audit, still not fixed

---

### Issue 2: Logger Still Logs to Console in Production
**File**: Need to verify `src/services/loggerService.ts`
**Impact**: MEDIUM-HIGH
**Status**: Need verification

---

### Issue 3: No Circuit Breaker for Failing APIs
**Impact**: LOW-MEDIUM
**Details**: Repeated failures to OpenMeteo will keep hammering the API
**Recommendation**: Implement circuit breaker pattern

---

## TypeScript Type Safety Gaps

### Gap 1: `any` in Error Handlers
**Count**: 98 instances still present
**Example**: `(error as any)` casts throughout codebase
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Loss of type safety in error paths

---

### Gap 2: Constants Type Not Readonly Deep
**File**: `src/constants/timings.ts:39, 58`
```typescript
} as const;
```

**Analysis**: `as const` makes the object readonly, but not deeply immutable. Properties can't be reassigned, but nested objects could be mutated (none exist here).

**Verdict**: SAFE for current structure

---
