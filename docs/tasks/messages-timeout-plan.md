# Messages Timeout Fix - Plan

## Context
- `src/context/MessagesContext.tsx` defines an inline `withTimeout` helper used throughout initialization.
- Logs show `Operation timed out` errors coming from the timeout rejection even when services succeed, implying the timer is not cleared.

## Findings
- `Promise.race` never clears the `setTimeout`, so the timeout callback still fires after the awaited promise resolves.
- Downstream `.catch` handlers log the error, leading to repeated noisy logs and false failure states.
- No other services currently handle these spurious errors, so resolving the helper should stop the failures without broader refactors.

## Plan
1. Refactor `withTimeout` to wrap the supplied promise, explicitly clearing the timer once the promise settles (resolve or reject).
2. Preserve the existing API (default `timeoutMs = 5000`) so callers stay untouched.
3. Re-run through initialization logic mentally to ensure no additional side effects arise from the change.

## Fresh Eyes Review (2025-10-01)
- Verified the revised `withTimeout` clears the timer on both resolution and rejection, eliminating the dangling timeout path.
- Confirmed the helper still respects the original timeout semantics and propagates errors without swallowing legitimate failures.
- Re-checked initialization sequencing in `MessagesContext` plus dependencies (`messageService`, `notificationService`, `alertRuleEngine`) for hidden assumptionsâ€”no additional issues spotted.
- Noted remaining verification should happen through a runtime smoke test to ensure logs stay clean under simulator/device conditions.

## TODO
- [x] Update `withTimeout` to clear the timeout and avoid double settlement.
- [x] Re-read `MessagesContext` initialization flow to confirm consistent error handling.
- [x] Skim `messageService`, `notificationService`, and `AlertRuleEngine` for assumptions about initialization timing.
- [ ] Run the app (simulator/device) and monitor `MESSAGES` logs to confirm timeout errors no longer appear.
- [ ] Capture a regression test case (manual or automated) covering timed-out initialization to guard against future regressions.
