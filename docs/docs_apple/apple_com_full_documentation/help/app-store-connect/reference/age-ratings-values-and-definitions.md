# Age ratings values and definitions

The _age rating_ is a required [app information](/help/app-store-
connect/reference/app-information) field used for property used by the
parental controls. These controls enable parents and guardians to establish a
safe online environment for children. As a developer, you can deliver age-
appropriate experiences tailored for users across all age groups.

In App Store Connect, you'll find a list of content descriptors, in-app
controls, and capabilities that allow you to specify the frequency or presence
of each in your app. Apple generates appropriate ratings based on your answer
to the age rating questionnaire. [Learn how to set an app age
rating.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/set-an-app-age-rating)

The tables below provide detailed information about the different age rating

**Note:** You’ll receive a message from App Review if the [Korean Games Rating
and Administration Committee(GRAC)](https://www.grac.or.kr/english/) issues an
official rating for your app that is different from your app’s age rating. If
you receive this notice, follow the instructions in the [override age rating
for Korea](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/set-an-app-age-
rating/#override-region-specific-ratings) section and re-submit your app for
review.
