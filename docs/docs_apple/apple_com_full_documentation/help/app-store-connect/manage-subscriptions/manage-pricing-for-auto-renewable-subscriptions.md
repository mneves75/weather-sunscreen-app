# Manage pricing for auto-renewable subscriptions

Auto-renewable subscriptions can be priced by App Store country or region
(also known as storefronts.) You can choose from 800 price points in each
currency, with the option for the Account Holder to submit a request for
additional higher price points.

After you set a starting price for your auto-renewable subscription, you can
schedule one future price change at a time, per country or region. If you
schedule a second price change when you already have a change scheduled, the
first scheduled change will be overwritten. You also have the option to
preserve prices for existing subscribers.

**Note:** It may take up to 1 hour for changes you make to product metadata to
appear in the sandbox environment.

[Learn how to configure auto-renewable subscription pricing with the App Store
Connect
API.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/app_store/auto-

### Increase the price of an auto-renewable subscription

Increases in auto-renewable subscription prices result in either a notice to
active subscribers or a request for consent, based on certain criteria below.
Subscribers on introductory or promotional price subscriptions, including free
trials and paid offers, will renew for at least one more billing period at the
price that was displayed when they subscribed, to ensure their notice or
request for consent for the new price is sent at least 30 days in advance. If
a subscriber doesn’t consent before the first renewal at the higher price,
their subscription will expire at the end of the last billing cycle at the
former price.

### Consent needed

If any of the following applies, subscribers must consent to the price
increase before their next renewal date in order for the subscription to
renew. * Apple will automatically contact subscribers by email or push
notification to request consent.

* If you increase the price of an auto-renewable subscription in India, subscribers who have enabled UPI AutoPay must consent to the new price and have a sufficient payment balance associated with their Apple Account, or they’ll go into the billing retry state at the end of their current billing period. Apple will notify these subscribers as part of the price increase notice, but you may also wish to notify subscribers separately. Subscribers who don’t have a sufficient Apple Account balance or who wish to continue paying with UPI AutoPay must repurchase the subscription at the new price. [Learn more.](https://support.apple.com//HT212781)

* For users converting from trials or offers in South Korea, Apple will collect consent via email, in-app sheets, or push notifications. The timing and frequency of these communications may differ from those shown for standard subscription price increases. [Learn more.](https://www.ftc.go.kr/www/selectBbsNttList.do?bordCd=3&key=12&searchCtgry=01,02)

  * The subscriber is located in a region that requires consent for any price changes.

  * The price increase is more than 50% of the current price and the difference in price exceeds approximately US$5 per period for non-annual subscriptions, or US$50 per year for annual subscriptions. (International equivalents for prices not in USD are based on current exchange rates with specific thresholds that are subject to change based on changes in taxes or foreign exchange rates.) [View a list of thresholds per storefront.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/auto-renewable-subscription-price-increase-thresholds)

  * The subscriber experienced a price increase for that subscription within the past 12 months.

The timing of price consent requests from Apple depends on the length of the
subscription. If a price increase occurs within the minimum required notice
period (7 days for weekly subscriptions, 27 days for 1 month subscriptions,
and 30 days for subscription durations longer than 1 month), subscribers will
renew at their existing price for one more billing period and will be notified
before the end of their next billing period.

Subscription duration |  First email notification (email, push, in-app messaging)  
---|---  
2 month, 3 month, and 6 month, and annual subscriptions |  60 days before renewal date  
Monthly subscriptions |  27 days before renewal date  
Weekly subscriptions |  7 days before renewal date  
  
If a subscriber doesn’t agree to the new price or takes no action, Apple will
continue to request consent approximately weekly through email, push
notifications, and in-app messaging until their subscription expires at the
end of their current billing cycle. [Learn about displaying in-app consent
messaging with
StoreKit.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymentqueue/3521327-showpriceconsentifneeded)

![Example screenshots of consent needed and not](/help/app-store-
connect/manage-subscriptions/manage-pricing-for-auto-renewable-
subscriptions/images/Consent-Not-needed_2x.png)

### Consent not needed

If none of the criteria apply, Apple will automatically notify subscribers of
the price increase with no additional request for consent. Notifications are
sent via email and push notifications if enabled by the subscriber 27 or 7
days before the next renewal date. On iOS 13.4 or later, Apple will also
notify subscribers via in-app messaging. If a price increase occurs within the
minimum required notice period, subscribers will renew at their existing price
for one more billing period and will be notified before the end of their next
billing period.

First email |  First in-app messaging |  Push notification  
---|---|---  
27 days before renewal date. **Note:** Weekly subscriptions renew at the increased price on the fourth consecutive renewal. |  First app launch after entering notice period. |  7 days before renewal date, if in-app messaging wasn't viewed.  
  
**Note:** Price changes only apply to active subscribers. If a subscription is
recovered in the billing retry or grace period state, it will renew at the
existing price for one more billing period. 27 days before the renewal date,
the subscriber receives notice of the price change, and the subscription
renews at the next renewal date at the new price. Subscribers won't receive a
notification if the subscription isn't going to renew.

start-times-by-country-or-region). Ensure you're scheduling your price changes
with enough time in advance.

     * **A** : Keep the current price for existing subscribers. Anyone who subscribed before the start date of this price change won’t be affected. Subscribers whose subscription expires can resubscribe at the preserved price within 60 days of expiration.

     * **B** : Apply the price change to existing subscribers who are paying the price of your subscription currently displayed on the App Store. App Store Connect will provide an indication if consent is required (or if they'll simply be notified) for each country or region. If you have customer groups that have had their prices preserved and your change is scheduled for the future, keep in mind that circumstances may change and consent will be required based on the conditions of the customer at the time of the increase. you're responsible for ensuring you understand when consent will be required.

###  FAQs

### How will changes to foreign exchange rates and tax adjustments affect
auto-renewable subscription pricing?

Apple will not make price adjustments on your auto-renewable subscription
products. Retail price changes initiated by Apple due to tax changes and
significant foreign exchange rate movements will exclude auto-renewable
subscriptions. For any value-added tax (VAT) rate changes, your proceeds and
Apple’s commission will be calculated after the deduction of VAT, which means
that your proceeds will change. You can choose to pass any changes caused by
taxation or foreign exchange onto your subscribers by adjusting the price for
your subscription.
