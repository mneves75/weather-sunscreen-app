# Apple Video Partner Program

Since 2016, the Apple Video Partner Program has enabled premium subscription
video providers to participate in a new TV watching experience on the Apple TV
app, helping customers discover the world’s best premium video content in one
app, across all their devices.

## How it works

This program is designed for apps that deliver premium subscription video
entertainment services. Participating apps are required to integrate with a
number of Apple technologies, such as Universal Search, Siri, AirPlay, and
single sign-on or zero sign-on, to ensure a seamless experience for customers.

As a result of this integration, these apps are featured on the Apple TV app
and throughout tvOS, and their content is discoverable through Universal
Search and Siri.

As a program member, you earn 85% of sales from customers who sign up using
Apple’s In-App Purchase system. You may also allow customers who subscribe
using your payment method outside of the app to use that payment method for
additional video transactions within the app. You must enable In-App Purchase
to enjoy these economic benefits.

## Participants

As of 2025, over 130 premium subscription video entertainment providers around
the world have signed on to participate in the program, such as Amazon Prime
Video, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), Claro Video, Crave,
Crunchyroll, Fox One, Globo, Joyn, HBO Max, Molotov, MUBI, Paramount+,
Peacock, Sony LIV, STARZ, Viaplay, Viki, ViX, WOW, and Zee5.
