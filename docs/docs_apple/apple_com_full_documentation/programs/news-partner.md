# Introducing the News Partner Program

At Apple, we believe all people should have access to reliable and trusted
news and information. We support a thriving news ecosystem through Apple News,
the App Store, and now the News Partner Program.

### Apple News and Apple News Format

The goal of Apple News is to provide customers access to trusted news and
information from many of the world’s top publishers. At the heart of Apple
News is [Apple News Format](/documentation/applenewsformat), which provides
the best mobile reading experience for news and scales seamlessly across
iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Apple News Format also supports advertising, and
publishers keep 100% of the revenue from ads they sell within Apple News.

### The News Partner Program

The News Partner Program is designed for subscription news publications that
provide their content to Apple News in Apple News Format. Publishers that work

diversify newsrooms and news coverage.
