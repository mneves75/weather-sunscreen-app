## Downloading and updating Xcode

You can download the latest version of Xcode for free from the [Mac App
Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12).

You can also download the latest Xcode beta, or previous versions of Xcode,
from the [downloads page](/download/all/?q=xcode) by signing in with your
Apple Account.

## Providing feedback and reporting issues

Developer feedback is vital to making Xcode even better. You can access
[Feedback Assistant](/bug-reporting/) directly from Xcode, and use it to
report issues you encounter or request enhancements to tools and services. You
can also visit the [Apple Developer Forums](/forums/tags/xcode) to ask
questions and find answers from Apple engineers and other developers.
