# Apple Security _Bounty_

If you submit research for a security or privacy vulnerability, your report
may be eligible for a reward. The Apple Security Bounty program is designed to
recognize your work in helping us protect the security and privacy of our
users.

## Submit your research.

If you believe you’ve discovered a security or privacy vulnerability that
affects Apple devices, software, or services, please report it directly to us.
We review all eligible research for Apple Security Bounty rewards. And with
our online tools, submitting and tracking your reports is easier than ever.

  * ## Easily send reports on the web.

Sign in with your Apple ID to securely submit a report. Reports should include
a thorough technical description of the behavior you observed, the steps
required to reproduce the issue, and a proof-of-concept or exploit.

  * ## View all your reports in one place.

When you sign in, you can see all your reports at a glance and track the
progress of individual reports while they’re being reviewed.

  * ## Communicate with us.

Apple engineers review and investigate every submission. You can interact
directly with us, and ask or respond to questions about your research.

  * ## Get notified along the way.

If your report results in a system or software update, you’ll see information
about when and how we’ll acknowledge your work. We’ll also automatically let
you know if you receive a reward through the Apple Security Bounty program.
