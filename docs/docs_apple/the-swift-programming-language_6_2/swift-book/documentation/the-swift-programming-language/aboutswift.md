# About Swift

Understand the high-level goals of the language.

Swift is a fantastic way to write software for phones, tablets, desktops,
servers, or anything else that runs code. It’s a safe and fast programming
language that combines the best in modern language thinking with wisdom from a
diverse open source community.

Swift is friendly to new programmers, without sacrificing the power and
flexibility that experienced programmers need. It’s an industrial-quality
programming language that’s as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting
language. The compiler is optimized for performance and the language is
optimized for development, without compromising on either.

Swift defines away large classes of common programming errors by adopting
modern programming patterns:

  * Variables are always initialized before use.

  * Array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors.

  * Integers are checked for overflow.

  * Optionals ensure that `nil` values are handled explicitly.

  * Memory is managed automatically.

  * Error handling allows controlled recovery from unexpected failures.

Swift code is compiled and optimized to get the most out of modern hardware.
The syntax and standard library have been designed based on the guiding
principle that the obvious way to write your code should also perform the
best. Its combination of safety and speed make Swift an excellent choice for
everything from “Hello, world!” to an entire operating system.

Swift combines a modern, lightweight syntax that’s familiar for developers
coming from other popular languages with powerful features like type inference
and pattern matching, allowing complex ideas to be expressed in a clear and
concise manner. As a result, code is easier to read, write, and maintain.

Swift continues to evolve with thoughtful new features and powerful
capabilities. The goals for Swift are ambitious. We can’t wait to see what you
create with it.
