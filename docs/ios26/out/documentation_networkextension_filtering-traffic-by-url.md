## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/filtering-traffic-by-url#Overview)

## [Configure the sample code project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/filtering-traffic-by-url#Configure-the-sample-code-project)

To configure the sample code project, do the following in Xcode:

1.  Set the developer team for all targets to your team so Xcode automatically manages the provisioning profile. For more information, see [Assign a project to a team](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev23aab79b4).
2.  Optionally build and run the Private Information Retrieval (PIR) server sample provided with the sample code download. If you have your own PIR server ready for use, you can use that instead.
