## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/building-rich-swiftui-text-experiences#Overview)

You can follow along with the code written in the WWDC25 session, learning how to upgrade `TextEditor` to rich text, build custom controls, and constrain the formatting options the editor provides.

After the code-along, you can learn more about how to persist rich text using SwiftData, and how to export rich text documents using the `Transferable` protocol.

### [Configure the sample code project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/building-rich-swiftui-text-experiences#Configure-the-sample-code-project)

To configure the sample code project, do the following in Xcode:

1.  Open the sample with the latest version of Xcode.
2.  Set the developer team to let Xcode automatically manage the provisioning profile. For more information, see [Set the bundle ID](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/preparing-your-app-for-distribution) and [Assign the project to a team](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/preparing-your-app-for-distribution).
