A great experience keeps people engaged with your app. A good design for your app’s interface is one way to engage people, but Apple platforms include features to enhance the usability of your content, and extend your app’s reach to other parts of the system. During the design process, incorporate the features that make sense into your plans.

## [Convenience](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technologyoverviews/core-experiences#Convenience)

Convenience is about making your app’s content available when people need it most, and on all their devices. Adopt features that help people access your app quickly and get directly to the content they want. Send that content where it’s needed most, including to one of their other devices.

- Improve how people access your content by adopting universal links in your app and website.
- Transfer relevant activities to another device using Handoff.
- Support features like Sign in with Apple, Shared with You, and QuickLook previews to speed up access to your content.
- Provide an App Clip so people can try your app’s features before they download the full version.

Give people the information they need, and help them access it quickly. Make content available from your app and from other parts of the system, such as the [Home Screen, Lock Screen, or Today view](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118610). Integrate new types of information that are difficult to produce and manage on your own, such as maps or weather information.

- Adopt fast search capabilities into your app using Spotlight.
- Provide widgets, complications, Live Activities, and Controls to make your app’s content available from the Lock Screen, the watch face, or other parts of the system.
- Display maps, weather information, user interface tips, rich link content and other information from your app’s interface.

## [Communication and connection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technologyoverviews/core-experiences#Communication-and-connection)

Communicate information in a timely and appropriate manner to improve people’s engagement with your app. Generate notifications to people informed of events that require their attention. Make it easier for people to connect with their friends and family through your app.

- Schedule local notifications from your app, or deliver push notifications from your own server with the help of Apple Push Notification service.
- Make your app’s content available from Siri.
- Support shared activities that people perform while on a FaceTime or from a Messages conversation.

## [App extensions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technologyoverviews/core-experiences#App-extensions)

Extend your app’s reach into other parts of the system using app extensions. Although you ship app extensions as part of your app, the system runs them as separate processes. Identify the types of app extensions you need, and learn how to share information between an app extension and your app.

- Learn about the types of app extensions you can create, including widgets, background asset downloaders, push notification services, and photo filters.
- Share data between your app and app extension.
- Let other developers extend your app by offering your own app extension programming model.
