## Installation

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install expo`

## API

    
    
    import * as Expo from 'expo';
    

### `expo/fetch` API

`expo/fetch` provides a [WinterCG-compliant Fetch
API](https://fetch.spec.wintercg.org/) that works consistently across web and
mobile environments, ensuring a standardized and cross-platform fetch
experience within Expo applications.

Streaming fetch

Copy

    
    
    import { fetch } from 'expo/fetch';
    
    const resp = await fetch('https://httpbin.org/drip?numbytes=512&duration=2', {
      headers: { Accept: 'text/event-stream' },
    });
    const reader = resp.body.getReader();
    const chunks = [];
    while (true) {
      const { done, value } = await reader.read();
      if (done) {
        break;
      }
      chunks.push(value);
    }
    const buffer = new Uint8Array(chunks.reduce((acc, chunk) => acc + chunk.length, 0));
    console.log(buffer.length); // 512
    

### Encoding APIs

`TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder` are built-in APIs that provide a way to encode
and decode text in various character encodings. They are available on all
platforms. Refer to the [browser and server runtime
support](https://caniuse.com/textencoder) for web and Node.js.

TextEncoder and TextDecoder

Copy

    
    
    // [104, 101, 108, 108, 111]
    const hello = new TextEncoder().encode('hello');
    
    // "hello"
    const text = new TextDecoder().decode(hello);
    

The `TextEncoder` API is included in the Hermes engine. See the [source code
in TextEncoder.cpp inside the Hermes GitHub
repository](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/blob/9e2bbf8eda15936ee00aee4f8e024ceaa7cd800d/lib/VM/JSLib/TextEncoder.cpp#L1).

The `TextDecoder` API is not [spec-
compliant](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#textdecoder) on native platforms.
Only the UTF-8 encoding is supported. If you need support for more encodings,
use a polyfill like [`text-encoding`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/text-
encoding).

The stream equivalents of these APIs, `TextEncoderStream` and
`TextDecoderStream`, are also available on all platforms. They allow you to
encode and decode text in a streaming manner, which is useful for processing
large amounts of data without loading it all into memory at once.

TextEncoderStream

Copy

    
    
    const encoder = new TextEncoderStream();
    const stream = new ReadableStream({
      start(controller) {
        controller.enqueue('Hello');
        controller.enqueue('World');
        controller.close();
      },
    });
    const reader = stream.pipeThrough(encoder).getReader();
    reader.read().then(({ done, value }) => {
      console.log(value); // Uint8Array [72, 101, 108, 108, 111]
    });
    

### Streams API

Global support for standard web streams is available on native platforms to
match the behavior of web and server platforms. Refer to the [browser and
server runtime support](https://caniuse.com/streams) for specific web and
Node.js support. EAS Hosting server runtime also includes support for the
standard web streams API.

Globally access `ReadableStream`, `WritableStream`, and `TransformStream`
classes.

ReadableStream

Copy

    
    
    const stream = new ReadableStream({
      start(controller) {
        controller.enqueue('Hello');
        controller.enqueue('World');
        controller.close();
      },
    });
    const reader = stream.getReader();
    reader.read().then(({ done, value }) => {
      console.log(value); // Hello
    });
    reader.read().then(({ done, value }) => {
      console.log(value); // World
    });
    

### URL API

`URL` provides the standard API on all platforms.

On native platforms, built-in `URL` and `URLSearchParams` implementations
replace the shims in `react-native`. Refer to the [browser and server runtime
support](https://caniuse.com/url) for web and Node.js.

URL and URLSearchParams

Copy

    
    
    const url = new URL('https://expo.dev');
    
    const params = new URLSearchParams();
    

Expo's built-in `URL` support attempts to be fully [spec
compliant](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL). The only
missing exception is that native platforms do not currently support [non-ASCII
characters](https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/) in the hostname.

Non-ASCII characters

Copy

    
    
    console.log(new URL('http://ðŸ¥“').toString());
    
    // This outputs the following:
    // - Web, Node.js: http://xn--pr9h/
    // - Android, iOS: http://ðŸ¥“/

    }
    

## Classes

### `EventEmitterType`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

A class that provides a consistent API for emitting and listening to events.
It shares many concepts with other emitter APIs, such as Node's EventEmitter
and `fbemitter`. When the event is emitted, all of the functions attached to
that specific event are called _synchronously_. Any values returned by the
called listeners are _ignored_ and discarded. Its implementation is written in
C++ and common for all the platforms.

EventEmitterType Methods

### `addListener(eventName, listener)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Parameter| Type  
---|---  
eventName| `EventName`  
listener| `TEventsMap[EventName]`  
  
  

Adds a listener for the given event name.

Returns:

`EventSubscription`

### `emit(eventName, ...args)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Parameter| Type  
---|---  
eventName| `EventName`  
...args| `Parameters<TEventsMap[EventName]>`  
  
  

Synchronously calls all the listeners attached to that specific event. The
event can include any number of arguments that will be passed to the
listeners.

Returns:

`void`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Parameter| Type  
---|---  
eventName| `keyof TEventsMap`  
  
  

Removes all listeners for the given event name.

Returns:

`void`

### `removeListener(eventName, listener)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Parameter| Type  
---|---  
eventName| `EventName`  
listener| `TEventsMap[EventName]`  
  
  

Removes a listener for the given event name.

Returns:

`void`

### `startObserving(eventName)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Parameter| Type  
---|---  
eventName| `EventName`  
  
  

Function that is automatically invoked when the first listener for an event
with the given name is added. Override it in a subclass to perform some
additional setup once the event started being observed.

Returns:

`void`

### `stopObserving(eventName)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Parameter| Type  
---|---  
eventName| `EventName`  
  
  

Function that is automatically invoked when the last listener for an event
with the given name is removed. Override it in a subclass to perform some
additional cleanup once the event is no longer observed.

Returns:

`void`

### `NativeModuleType`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Type: Class extends
`[EventEmitter](/versions/v54.0.0/sdk/expo#eventemittertype)<TEventsMap>`

A class for all native modules. Extends the EventEmitter class.

### `SharedObjectType`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Type: Class extends
`[EventEmitter](/versions/v54.0.0/sdk/expo#eventemittertype)<TEventsMap>`
implements
`[EventEmitter](/versions/v54.0.0/sdk/expo#eventemittertype)<TEventsMap>`

Base class for all shared objects that extends the EventEmitter class. The
implementation is written in C++, installed through JSI and common for mobile
platforms.

SharedObjectType Methods

### `release()`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

A function that detaches the JS and native objects to let the native object
deallocate before the JS object gets deallocated by the JS garbage collector.
Any subsequent calls to native functions of the object will throw an error as
it is no longer associated with its native counterpart.

In most cases, you should never need to use this function, except some
specific performance-critical cases when manual memory management makes sense
and the native object is known to exclusively retain some native memory (such
as binary data or image bitmap). Before calling this function, you should
ensure that nothing else will use this object later on. Shared objects created
by React hooks are usually automatically released in the effect's cleanup
phase, for example: `useVideoPlayer()` from `expo-video` and `useImage()` from
`expo-image`.

Returns:

`void`

### `SharedRefType`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Type: Class extends
`[SharedObject](/versions/v54.0.0/sdk/expo#sharedobjecttype)<TEventsMap>`
implements
`[SharedObject](/versions/v54.0.0/sdk/expo#sharedobjecttype)<TEventsMap>`

A SharedObject that holds a reference to any native object. Allows passing
references to native instances among different independent libraries.

For instance, `ImageRef` from `expo-image` references a
[Drawable](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/drawable/Drawable)
on Android and an
[UIImage](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimage) on iOS.
Since both types are common on these platforms, different native modules can
use them without depending on each other. In particular, this enables the
`expo-image-manipulator` to pass the resulted image directly to the image view
from `expo-image` without any additional writes and reads from the file
system.

SharedRefType Properties

### `nativeRefType`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Type: `string`

The type of the native reference.

## Methods

### `isRunningInExpoGo()`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Returns a boolean value whether the app is running in Expo Go.

Returns:

`boolean`

### `registerRootComponent(component)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Parameter| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
component| `ComponentType<P>`| The React component class that renders the rest
of your app.  
  
  

Sets the initial React component to render natively in the app's root React
Native view on Android, iOS, tvOS and the web.

This method does the following:

  * Invokes React Native's `AppRegistry.registerComponent`.
  * Invokes React Native web's `AppRegistry.runApplication` on web to render to the root `index.html` file.
  * Polyfills the `process.nextTick` function globally.

This method also adds the following dev-only features that are removed in
production bundles.

  * Adds the Fast Refresh and bundle splitting indicator to the app.
  * Asserts if the `expo-updates` package is misconfigured.
  * Asserts if `react-native` is not aliased to `react-native-web` when running in the browser.

Returns:

`void`

> See: For information on how to setup `registerRootComponent` in an existing
> (bare) React Native app, see Common questions below.

Parameter| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
moduleImplementation| `ModuleType`| A class that extends `NativeModule`. The
class is registered under `globalThis.expo.modules[className]`.  
moduleName| `string`| â€“ a name to register the module under
`globalThis.expo.modules[className]`.  
  
  

Registers a web module.

Returns:

`ModuleType`

Web

Parameter| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
reason(optional)| `string`| The reason for reloading the app. This is used
only for some platforms.  
  
  

Reloads the app. This method works for both release and debug builds.

Unlike
[`Updates.reloadAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/updates#updatesreloadasync),
this function does not use a new update even if one is available. It only
reloads the app using the same JavaScript bundle that is currently running.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`

### `requireNativeModule(moduleName)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Parameter| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
moduleName| `string`| Name of the requested native module.  
  
  

Imports the native module registered with given name. In the first place it
tries to load the module installed through the JSI host object and then falls
back to the bridge proxy module. Notice that the modules loaded from the proxy
may not support some features like synchronous functions.

Returns:

`ModuleType`

Object representing the native module.

### `requireNativeView(moduleName, viewName)`

instead of throwing an error.

Returns:

`ModuleType | null`

Object representing the native module or `null` when it cannot be found.

## Event Subscriptions

### `useEventListener(eventEmitter, eventName, listener)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Web

Parameter| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
eventEmitter|
`[EventEmitter](/versions/v54.0.0/sdk/expo#eventemittertype)<TEventsMap>`| An
object that emits events. For example, a native module or shared object or an
instance of `EventEmitter`.  
eventName| `TEventName`| Name of the event to listen to.  
listener| `TEventListener`| A function to call when the event is dispatched.  
  
  

React hook that listens to events emitted by the given object and calls the
listener function whenever a new event is dispatched. The event listener is
automatically added during the first render and removed when the component
unmounts.

Returns:

`void`

Example

    
    
    import { useEventListener } from 'expo';
    import { useVideoPlayer, VideoView } from 'expo-video';
    
    export function VideoPlayerView() {
      const player = useVideoPlayer(videoSource);
    
      useEventListener(player, 'playingChange', ({ isPlaying }) => {

      return <VideoView player={player} />;
    }
    

## Types

## Common questions

Some common questions about using the `expo` package in your project.

`rootRegisterComponent` setup for existing React Native projects

If you are managing your React Native project's native directories (android
and ios) manually, you need to follow the instructions below to set up the
`registerRootComponent` function. This is necessary for the Expo modules to
work correctly.

Android

Update the android/app/src/main/your-package/MainActivity.java file to use the
name `main` in the `getMainComponentName` function.

android/app/src/main/your-package/MainActivity.java

Copy

    
    
      @Override
      protected String getMainComponentName() {
    +    return "main";
      }
    

iOS

Update the iOS ios/your-project/AppDelegate.(m|mm|swift) file to use the
moduleName `main` in the `createRootViewWithBridge:bridge moduleName:@"main"
initialProperties:initProps` line of the
`application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` function.

What if I want to name my main app file something other than App.js or
app/_layout.tsx?

For projects that do not use [Expo Router](/router/introduction), you can set
the `"main"` in package.json to any file within your project. If you do this,
then you need to use `registerRootComponent`. The `export default` will not
make this component the root for the app if you are using a custom entry file.

For example, let's say you want to make src/main.jsx the entry file for your
app â€” maybe you don't like having JavaScript files in the project root. First,
set this in package.json:

package.json

Copy

    
    
    {
      "main": "src/main.jsx"
    }
    

Then, in src/main.jsx, make sure you call `registerRootComponent` and pass in
the component you want to render at the root of the app:

src/main.jsx

Copy

    
    
    import { registerRootComponent } from 'expo';
    import { View } from 'react-native';
    
    function App() {
      return <View />;
    }
    
    registerRootComponent(App);
    

For projects that use [Expo Router](/router/introduction), you can create a
custom entry point by following these steps from [Expo Router's installation
guide](/router/installation#custom-entry-point-to-initialize-and-load). To use
the top-level src directory in your Expo Router project, see [src directory
reference](/router/reference/src-directory) for more information.
