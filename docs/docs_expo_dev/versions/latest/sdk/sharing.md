`expo-sharing` allows you to share files directly with other compatible
applications.

#### Sharing limitations on web

  * `expo-sharing` for web is built on top of the Web Share API, which still has [very limited browser support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=web-share). Be sure to check that the API can be used before calling it by using `Sharing.isAvailableAsync()`.
  * HTTPS required on web: The Web Share API is only available on web when the page is served over https. Run your app with `npx expo start --tunnel` to enable it.
  * No local file sharing on web: Sharing local files by URI works on Android and iOS, but not on web. You cannot share local files on web by URI â€” you will need to upload them somewhere and share that URI.

#### Sharing to your app from other apps

Currently `expo-sharing` only supports sharing _from your app to other apps_
and you cannot register to your app to have content shared to it through the
native share dialog on native platforms. You can read more [in the related
feature request](https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/share-extension-ios-
share-intent-android). You can setup this functionality manually in Xcode and
Android Studio and create an [Expo Config Plugin](/config-
plugins/introduction) to continue using [Expo Prebuild](/workflow/prebuild).

## Installation

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install expo-sharing`

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview),
make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.
