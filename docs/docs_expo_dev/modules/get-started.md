There are two ways to get started with the Expo Modules API: you can either
initialize a new module from scratch or add the Expo Modules API to an
existing module. This guide will walk you through creating a new module from
scratch, and the [Integrating in an existing library](/modules/existing-
library) covers the latter.

The two recommended flows to create a new module with Expo Modules API:

  * [Add a new module to an existing Expo application](/modules/get-started#add-a-new-module-to-an-existing-application), and use it to test and develop your module.

  * [Create a new module in isolation with a generated example project](/modules/get-started#create-a-new-module-with-an-example-project) if you want to reuse it in multiple projects or publish it to npm.

Both of these flows are covered in the next sections.

## Add a new module to an existing application

1

### Create the local Expo module

Navigate to your project directory (the one that contains the package.json
file) and run the following command. This is the recommended way to create a
local Expo module.

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx create-expo-module@latest --local`

You can provide a meaningful module name in the CLI prompt. For the rest of
the prompts, you can also accept the default suggestions.

Once you've run the command, you will see a new directory created in your
project called modules. The directory structure should look like this:

`modules`

`my-module`

`android`

`ios`

`src`

`expo-module.config.json`

`index.ts`

Then, if your project doesn't have native projects generated (android and ios
directories), run the following command, otherwise skip this command:

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo prebuild --clean`

> Note: If you have a pre-existing ios directory in your project's root which
> was created using `npx expo prebuild`, you must reinstall the pods:
>
>  
>
>
> Terminal
>
> Copy
>
> `- ``npx pod-install`

### Use the local module

Import the local module in your application, for example in App.js or App.tsx
or app/(tabs)/index.tsx:

app/(tabs)/index.tsx

Copy

    
    
    %%placeholder-start%%...%%placeholder-end%%
    import MyModule from '@/modules/my-module';
    
    export default function HomeScreen() {
      return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <Text>{MyModule.hello()}</Text>
        </View>
      );
    }
    

Start the development sever in your terminal so that when you edit the native
module and build the app in the next step, the changes will be reflected in
the app:

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo start`

Congratulations! You have created a local Expo module. You can now start
working on it.

> Tip: You can also use absolute import paths [by applying these configuration
> changes](https://expo.fyi/absolute-path-expo-modules.md).

### Edit the module

To develop and test your module locally, let's use Android Studio and Xcode
for Android and iOS.

#### Android

  1. Open the android directory (that is generated by `npx expo prebuild` in step 1) from your project in Android Studio. It may take a while for Gradle to finish syncing the native directory project.
  2. Once the project is synced, open modules/my-module/android/src/main/java/expo/modules/mymodule/MyModule.kt file.
  3. Change `hello` function to return a different string, such as "Hello world! 🌎🤖" and save the file.
  4. Build the app by clicking Run 'app' button from top menu bar and you will see the changes on the screen.

You have to repeat the build step anytime you make a change to the native code
to the changes.

#### iOS

  1. Open the ios directory (that is generated by `npx expo prebuild` in step 1) from your project in Xcode by running `xed ios` command.
  2. Under Pods > Development Pods > MyModule, open MyModule.swift file.
  3. Change `hello` function to return a different string, such as "Hello world! 🌎🍎" and save the file.
  4. Build your app by clicking Run button from top menu bar or press `⌘ Cmd` \+ `R`, you will see the changes on the screen.

You have to repeat the build step anytime you make a change to the native code
to the changes.

> Tip: Use `npx pod-install` to reinstall the pods if you add new native files
> to the module or when you modify expo-module.config.json.

> Note: There are also other flows for working on an Expo module in parallel
> with your application. For example, you can use a monorepo or publish to
> npm, as described in the [How to use a standalone Expo module](/modules/use-
> standalone-expo-module-in-your-project) guide.

## Create a new module with an example project

1

### Create the Expo module

To create a new Expo module from scratch, run the `create-expo-module` script
as shown below. The script will ask you a few questions and then generate the
native Expo module along with the example app for Android and iOS that uses
your new module.

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx create-expo-module@latest my-module`

2

### Open the module and start the development server

Navigate to the module directory and then open the Android and/or iOS example
project by running the following commands:

Terminal

`- ``cd my-module`

`- ``npm run open:android`

`- ``npm run open:ios`

Go to example directory and start the development sever in your terminal so
that when you edit the native module and build the app in the next step, the
changes will be reflected in the app:

Terminal

Copy

`- ``cd example`

`- ``npx expo start`

> Note: If you're using Windows, you can open the example project by opening
> the android directory in Android Studio, but you cannot open the iOS project
> files.

### Edit the module

#### Android

  1. Open my-module/android/src/main/java/expo/modules/mymodule/MyModule.kt file.
  2. Change `hello` function to return a different string, such as "Hello world! 🌎🤖" and save the file.
  3. Build the app by clicking Run 'app' button from top menu bar and you will see the changes on the screen.

You have to repeat the build step anytime you make a change to the native code
to the changes.

#### iOS

  1. Under Pods > Development Pods > MyModule, open MyModule.swift file.
  2. Change `hello` function to return a different string, such as "Hello world! 🌎🍎" and save the file.
  3. Build your app by clicking Run button from top menu bar or press `⌘ Cmd` \+ `R`, you will see the changes on the screen.

You have to repeat the build step anytime you make a change to the native code
to the changes.

> Tip: Use `npx pod-install` to reinstall the pods if you add new native files
> to the module or when you modify expo-module.config.json.

to it, you can continue to a tutorial or dive right into the API reference.
