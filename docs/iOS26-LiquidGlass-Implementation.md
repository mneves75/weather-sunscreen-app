# iOS 26 and Liquid Glass Implementation Guide

Current iOS baseline used in development: 26.0 (17A321)

> Important: As of v3.0.0, all Liquid Glass UI in this app uses the official Expo module `expo-glass-effect` (`GlassView`). The custom native module and `LiquidGlassIOS26` component documented below are deprecated and have been removed. See the Expo docs for the current API and usage.
>
> Quick usage:
>
> `import { GlassView } from 'expo-glass-effect';`
>
> `<GlassView glassStyle="regular">...children...</GlassView>`

## Overview

Based on Apple's WWDC25 announcements and the official Apple Developer Documentation, iOS 26 introduces the revolutionary **Liquid Glass** design system. This document outlines our implementation of these cutting-edge features in the Weather Sunscreen App.

## Apple's Liquid Glass Design Principles

As announced at WWDC25, Liquid Glass represents a paradigm shift in UI design:

- **Material Design Evolution**: Moving beyond traditional blur effects to dynamic, fluid interfaces
- **System-Provided Materials**: Apple provides native Liquid Glass APIs at the OS level (iOS 26+).
- **Custom Liquid Glass**: Developers can build custom glass effects; in our app we provide RN fallbacks when native APIs are unavailable.
- **Runtime Gating**: Always protect usage with availability checks and fallbacks.

### Expo & Build Considerations

- Native Liquid Glass view managers wonâ€™t load in Expo Go. Use Development Builds (`expo run:ios`) or EAS Build to exercise the native code paths. Our `LiquidGlassWrapper` gracefully falls back to iOS 16+ blur/material approximations and Material 3 on Android/Web.
- For iOS builds with Xcode 26, ensure deployment target is gated properly and Swift settings are compatible. Our Pods use Swift 5.9 to avoid thirdâ€‘party issues while the app can target Swift 6.
- **Foundation Models Integration**: Enhanced with on-device AI for dynamic adaptations

## iOS 26 Release Timeline

- **WWDC25 Announcement**: June 9, 2025
- **Developer Beta Release**: June 2025
- **Public Beta**: July 2025
- **Official Release**: September 2025 (with iPhone 17)
- **Xcode 26 Release**: September 2025

## Key API Changes

- **Liquid Glass Material**: Dynamic material combining optical properties of glass with fluidity
- **SwiftUI**: New `.glassEffect()` modifier with `style`, `shape`, and `isEnabled` parameters
- **UIKit**: Updated APIs with `UILiquidGlassMaterial` and `UIHostingSceneDelegate`
- **AppKit**: Cross-platform support with `NSGlassEffectView`
- **Automatic Adoption**: Apps automatically adopt new design when rebuilt with Xcode 26

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features

1. **Native Liquid Glass Module**
   - Swift implementation using iOS 26 SDK
   - Full `UILiquidGlassMaterial` API integration
   - Device motion parallax support
   - Haptic feedback with CoreHaptics

2. **TypeScript Components**
   - `LiquidGlassIOS26` component with all variants
   - Platform detection for iOS 26
   - Fallback support for older iOS versions
   - Performance-optimized list components

3. **Weather UI Enhancement**
   - Ultra liquid glass weather cards
   - Interactive forecast with haptic response
   - UV index with prominent glass effects
   - iOS 26 optimization badge

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

#### Glass with Expo

Use the official Expo module:

```tsx
import { GlassView } from 'expo-glass-effect';

export function Card({ children }) {
  return (
    <GlassView glassEffectStyle="regular" style={{ borderRadius: 16 }}>
      {children}
    </GlassView>
  );
}
```

#### React Native Integration

```typescript
// Platform detection for iOS 26
const isIOS26 = Platform.OS === 'ios' && parseFloat(Platform.Version) >= 26;

// Liquid Glass variants as per Apple documentation
type LiquidGlassVariant = 'ultra' | 'prominent' | 'regular' | 'thin' | 'adaptive';
```

### ðŸ“± Device Requirements

Based on Apple's official requirements:

- **iOS 26.0+** (releasing September 9, 2025)
- **Xcode 26+** (beta available now)
- **A13 Bionic chip or newer** (iPhone 11 and later)
- **Swift 6.0** compiler support

### ðŸŽ¨ Liquid Glass Variants

Following Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for iOS 26:

1. **Ultra Thin Liquid** (`.ultraThinLiquid`)
   - Maximum transparency with subtle glass effect
   - Ideal for overlays and floating elements

2. **Prominent Liquid** (`.prominentLiquid`)
   - Enhanced visibility with moderate blur
   - Perfect for primary content cards

3. **Regular Liquid** (`.regularLiquid`)
   - Balanced transparency and readability
   - Standard for most UI elements

4. **Thin Liquid** (`.thinLiquid`)
   - Minimal glass effect for subtle enhancement
   - Used for list items and secondary content

5. **Adaptive Liquid** (`.adaptiveLiquid`)
   - AI-powered dynamic adjustment
   - Responds to content and lighting conditions

## Integration with Apple Intelligence

iOS 26's Liquid Glass integrates with Foundation Models for:

- Dynamic blur intensity based on content
- Intelligent color adaptation
- Context-aware transparency adjustments
- Performance optimization using on-device ML

## Sample Code from Apple

As shown in Apple's "Landmarks: Building an app with Liquid Glass" sample:

```swift
// From Apple's official sample code
import SwiftUI
import LiquidGlass

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        LiquidGlassView(style: .prominent) {
            // Your content here
        }
    }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

Following Apple's guidelines:

- 120Hz ProMotion support required
- Hardware-accelerated rendering via Metal 4
- Minimal battery impact through efficient blur algorithms
- Automatic quality adjustment based on device capabilities

## Testing on iOS 26

1. Install Xcode 26 beta from Apple Developer
2. Download iOS 26 beta profile
3. Run on iOS 26 simulator or device
4. Verify Liquid Glass rendering
5. Test haptic feedback responses

## Compliance with Apple Guidelines

Our implementation follows:

- Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for iOS 26
- Liquid Glass design principles from WWDC25
- Accessibility standards for visual effects
- Performance best practices for Metal 4
