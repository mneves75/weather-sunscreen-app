# What is Codegen?

**Codegen** is a tool to avoid writing a lot of repetitive code. Using Codegen
**is not mandatory** : you can write all the generated code manually. However,
Codegen generates scaffolding code that could save you a lot of time.

React Native invokes Codegen automatically every time an iOS or Android app is
built. Occasionally, you would like to manually run the Codegen scripts to
know which types and files are actually generated: this is a common scenario
when developing [Turbo Native Modules](/docs/turbo-native-modules-
introduction) and Fabric Native Components.

## How Codegen Worksâ€‹

**Codegen** is a process that is tightly coupled with a React Native app. The
Codegen scripts live inside the `react-native` NPM package and the apps call
those scripts at build time.

Codegen crawls the folders in your project, starting from a directory you
specify in your `package.json`, looking for some specific JS files that
contain the specification (or specs) for your custom modules and components.
Spec files are JS files written in a typed dialect: React Native currently
supports Flow and TypeScript.

Every time Codegen finds a spec file, it generates boilerplate code associated
with it. Codegen generates some C++ glue-code and then it generates platform-
specific code, using Java for Android and Objective-C++ for iOS.
