# Introduction

Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for
getting started instructions, they've moved to [their own
section](environment-setup). Continue reading for an introduction to the
documentation, Native Components, React, and more!

Many different kinds of people use React Native: from advanced iOS developers
to React beginners, to people getting started programming for the first time
in their career. These docs were written for all learners, no matter their
experience level or background.

## How to use these docs​

You can start here and read through these docs linearly like a book; or you
can read the specific sections you need. Already familiar with React? You can
skip [that section](/docs/0.80/intro-react)—or read it for a light refresher.

## Prerequisites​

To work with React Native, you will need to have an understanding of
JavaScript fundamentals. If you’re new to JavaScript or need a refresher, you
can [dive in](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) or
[brush up](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-
introduction_to_JavaScript) at Mozilla Developer Network.

> While we do our best to assume no prior knowledge of React, Android, or iOS
> development, these are valuable topics of study for the aspiring React
> Native developer. Where sensible, we have linked to resources and articles
> that go more in depth.

## Interactive examples​

This introduction lets you get started immediately in your browser with
interactive examples like this one:

The above is a Snack Player. It’s a handy tool created by Expo to embed and
run React Native projects and share how they render in platforms like Android
and iOS. The code is live and editable, so you can play directly with it in
your browser. Go ahead and try changing the "Try editing me!" text above to
"Hello, world!"

> Optionally, if you want to set up a local development environment, [you can
> follow our guide to setting up your environment on your local
> machine](/docs/0.80/set-up-your-environment) and paste the code examples
> into your project. (If you are a web developer, you may already have a local
> environment set up for mobile browser testing!)

## Developer Notes​

People from many different development backgrounds are learning React Native.
You may have experience with a range of technologies, from web to Android to
iOS and more. We try to write for developers from all backgrounds. Sometimes
we provide explanations specific to one platform or another like so:

  * Android
  * iOS
  * Web

> Android developers may be familiar with this concept.

> iOS developers may be familiar with this concept.

> Web developers may be familiar with this concept.

## Formatting​

Menu paths are written in bold and use carets to navigate submenus. Example:
**Android Studio > Preferences**

Now that you know how this guide works, it's time to get to know the
foundation of React Native: [Native Components](/docs/0.80/intro-react-native-
components).
