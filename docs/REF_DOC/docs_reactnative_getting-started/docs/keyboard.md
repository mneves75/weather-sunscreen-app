as well as make changes to the keyboard, like dismissing it.

# Reference

## Methods‚Äã

### `addListener()`‚Äã

tsx

    
    
    static addListener: (  
      eventType: KeyboardEventName,  
      listener: KeyboardEventListener,  
    ) => EmitterSubscription;  
    

The `addListener` function connects a JavaScript function to an identified
native keyboard notification event.

This function then returns the reference to the listener.

**Parameters:**

Name| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
eventName Required| string| The string that identifies the event you're
listening for. See the list below.  
callback Required| function| The function to be called when the event fires  
  
**`eventName`**

This can be any of the following:

  * `keyboardWillShow`
  * `keyboardDidShow`
  * `keyboardWillHide`
  * `keyboardDidHide`
  * `keyboardWillChangeFrame`
  * `keyboardDidChangeFrame`

> Note that only `keyboardDidShow` and `keyboardDidHide` events are available
> on Android. The events will not be fired when using Android 10 and under if
> your activity has `android:windowSoftInputMode` set to `adjustNothing`.
