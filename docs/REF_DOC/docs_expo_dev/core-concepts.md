Expo is an [open-source framework](https://github.com/expo/expo/) for apps
that run natively on Android, iOS, and the web. Expo brings together the best
of mobile and the web and enables many important features for building and
scaling an app.

The `expo` npm package enables a suite of incredible features for React Native
apps. The `expo` package can be installed in nearly any React Native project.

## Tools and features

> All features are free, optional, and can be used independently of each
> other. Unused features add no additional bloat to your app.

The team behind Expo also provides Expo Application Services (EAS), deeply
integrated cloud services for building, submitting, and updating your React
Native app. EAS can be used with any React Native app, regardless of whether
it uses `expo` or not.
