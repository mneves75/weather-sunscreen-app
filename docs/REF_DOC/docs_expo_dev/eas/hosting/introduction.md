EAS Hosting is a service for quickly deploying your web projects built using
[Expo Router](/router/introduction) and React Native web. It seamlessly
integrates with the Expo CLI, allowing you to automate the deployment of API
routes, server functions, and server-side assets.

Hosting offers the fastest path from `npx create-expo-app` to a fully deployed
web app with API routes and server functions.
