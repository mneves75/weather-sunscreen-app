Let's set up a local development environment for running your project on
Android and iOS.

## Where would you like to develop?

We recommend using a real device to develop, since you'll get to see exactly
what your users will see.

## How would you like to develop?

Expo Go is a sandbox for trying out Expo quickly. A development build is a
build of your own app that includes Expo's developer tools.
