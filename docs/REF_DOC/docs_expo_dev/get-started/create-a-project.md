System requirements:

  * [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/).
  * macOS, Windows (Powershell and [WSL 2](https://expo.fyi/wsl)), and Linux are supported.

We recommend starting with the default project created by `create-expo-app`.
The default project includes example code to help you get started.

To create a new project, run the following command:

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx create-expo-app@latest`

> You can choose a different template by adding the [`--template`
> option](/more/create-expo#--template).

## Next step

You have a project. Now it's time to set up your development environment so
that you can start developing.
