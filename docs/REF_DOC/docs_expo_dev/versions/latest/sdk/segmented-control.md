It's like a fancy radio button, or in Apple's words: "A horizontal control
that consists of multiple segments, each segment functioning as a discrete
button"
([source](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uisegmentedcontrol)).
This component renders to a
[`UISegmentedControl`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uisegmentedcontrol)
on iOS, and to faithful recreations of that control on Android and web
(because no equivalent exists on those platforms' standard libraries).
