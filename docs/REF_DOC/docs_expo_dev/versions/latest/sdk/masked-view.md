`@react-native-masked-view/masked-view` provides a masked view that only
displays the pixels that overlap with the view rendered in its mask element.

> You can only have one of either `@react-native-community/masked-view`
> (deprecated) or `@react-native-masked-view/masked-view` installed in your
> project at any given time. React Navigation v6 and above requires `@react-
> native-masked-view/masked-view`, so you should use that package instead if
> you are using the latest version of React Navigation.

> Android support for this library is experimental and you may encounter
> inconsistencies in behavior across platforms. Report issues you encounter to
> [`react-native-masked-view` GitHub repository](https://github.com/react-
> native-masked-view/masked-view).
