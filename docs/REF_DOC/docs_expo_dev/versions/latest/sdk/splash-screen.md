The `SplashScreen` module from the `expo-splash-screen` library is used to
tell the splash screen to remain visible until it has been explicitly told to
hide. This is useful to do tasks that will happen behind the scenes such as
making API calls, pre-loading fonts, animating the splash screen and so on.

> From SDK 52, due to changes supporting the latest Android splash screen API,
> Expo Go and development builds cannot fully replicate the splash screen
> experience your users will see in your [standalone app](/more/glossary-of-
> terms#standalone-app). Expo Go will show your app icon instead of the splash
> screen, and the splash screen on development builds will not reflect all
> properties set in the config plugin. It is highly recommended that you test
> your splash screen on a release build to ensure it looks as expected.

Also, see the guide on [creating a splash screen image](/develop/user-
interface/splash-screen-and-app-icon#splash-screen), or [quickly generate an
icon and splash screen using your browser](https://buildicon.netlify.app/).

## Installation

Terminal

Copy

`- ``npx expo install expo-splash-screen`

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview),
make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

This example shows how to keep the splash screen visible while loading app
resources and then hide the splash screen when the app has rendered some
initial content.

With Expo Router

Without Expo Router

app/_layout.tsx

Copy

    
    
    import { useFonts } from 'expo-font';
    import { Stack } from 'expo-router';
    import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';
    import { useEffect } from 'react';
    
    // Set the animation options. This is optional.
    SplashScreen.setOptions({
      duration: 1000,
      fade: true,
    });
    
    SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();
    
    export default function RootLayout() {
      const [loaded] = useFonts({
        SpaceMono: require('../assets/fonts/SpaceMono-Regular.ttf'),
      });
    
      useEffect(() => {
        if (loaded) {
          SplashScreen.hide();
        }
      }, [loaded]);
    
      if (!loaded) {
        return null;
      }
    
      return <Stack />;
    }
    

App.js

Copy

    
    
    import { useCallback, useEffect, useState } from 'react';
    import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
    import Entypo from '@expo/vector-icons/Entypo';
    import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';
    import * as Font from 'expo-font';
    
    // Keep the splash screen visible while we fetch resources
    SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();
    
    // Set the animation options. This is optional.
    SplashScreen.setOptions({
      duration: 1000,
      fade: true,
    });
    
    export default function App() {
      const [loaded] = useFonts({
        SpaceMono: require('../assets/fonts/SpaceMono-Regular.ttf'),
      });
    
      useEffect(() => {
        if (loaded) {
          SplashScreen.hideAsync();
        }
      }, [loaded]);
    
      if (!loaded) {
        return null;
      }
    
      return (
        <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
          <Text>SplashScreen Demo! ðŸ‘‹</Text>
          <Entypo name="rocket" size={30} />
        </View>
      );
    }
    

## Configuration

You can configure `expo-splash-screen` using its built-in [config
plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your
project ([EAS Build](/build/introduction) or `npx expo run:[android|ios]`).
The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at
runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does
not use EAS Build, then you'll need to manually configure the package.

Using the config plugin, as shown below, is the recommended method for
configuring the splash screen. The other methods are now considered legacy and
will be removed in the future.

### Example app.json with config plugin

app.json

Copy

    
    
    {
      "expo": {
        "plugins": [
          [
            "expo-splash-screen",
            {
              "backgroundColor": "#232323",
              "image": "./assets/splash-icon.png",
              "dark": {
                "image": "./assets/splash-icon-dark.png",
                "backgroundColor": "#000000"
              },
              "imageWidth": 200
            }
          ]
        ],
      }
    }
    

### Configurable properties

Name| Default| Description  
---|---|---  
`backgroundColor`| `#ffffff`| A hex color string representing the background
color of the splash screen.  
`image`| `undefined`| The path to the image file that will be displayed on the
splash screen. This should be your app icon or logo.  
`enableFullScreenImage_legacy`| `false`| Only for: iOS  
Enabling this property allows using a full screen image as the splashscreen.
This is to help with the transition from the legacy splash screen
configuration and will be removed in the future.  
`dark`| `undefined`| An object containing properties for configuring the
splash screen when the device is in dark mode.  
`imageWidth`| `100`| The width to make the image.  
`android`| `undefined`| An object containing properties for configuring the
splash screen on Android.  
`ios`| `undefined`| An object containing properties for configuring the splash
screen on iOS.  
`resizeMode`| `undefined`| Determines how the image is scaled to fit the
container defined by `imageWidth`. Possible values: `contain`, `cover`, or
`native`.  
  
You can also configure `expo-splash-screen`, using the following [app
config](/workflow/configuration) properties but the config plugin should be
preferred.

  * [`splash`](/versions/latest/config/app#splash)
  * [`android.splash`](/versions/latest/config/app#splash-2)
  * [`ios.splash`](/versions/latest/config/app#splash-1)

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

See how to configure the native projects in the [installation instructions in
the `expo-splash-screen`
repository](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/expo-splash-
screen#-installation-in-bare-react-native-projects).

### Animating the splash screen

`SplashScreen` provides an out-of-the-box fade animation. It can be configured
using the `setOptions` method.

    
    
    SplashScreen.setOptions({
      duration: 1000,
      fade: true,
    });
    

If you prefer to use custom animation, see the [`with-splash-
screen`](https://github.com/expo/examples/tree/master/with-splash-screen)
example on how to apply any arbitrary animations to your splash screen. You
can initialize a new project from this example by running `npx create-expo-app
--example with-splash-screen`.

## API

    
    
    import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';
    

## Methods

### `SplashScreen.hide()`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Hides the native splash screen immediately. Be careful to ensure that your app
has content ready to display when you hide the splash screen, or you may see a
blank screen briefly. See the "Usage" section for an example.

Returns:

`void`

### `SplashScreen.hideAsync()`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Hides the native splash screen immediately. This method is provided for
backwards compatability. See the "Usage" section for an example.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`

### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Makes the native splash screen (configured in `app.json`) remain visible until
`hideAsync` is called.

> Important note: It is recommended to call this in global scope without
> awaiting, rather than inside React components or hooks, because otherwise
> this might be called too late, when the splash screen is already hidden.

Returns:

`[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<boolean>`

Example

    
    
    import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';
    
    SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();
    
    export default function App() {
     // ...
    }
    

### `SplashScreen.setOptions(options)`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Parameter| Type  
---|---  
options| `SplashScreenOptions`  
  
  

Configures the splashscreens default animation behavior.

Returns:

`void`

## Types

### `SplashScreenOptions`

Android

iOS

tvOS

Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---
