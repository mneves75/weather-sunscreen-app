Once you've made changes on a branch, you can share them with your team by
publishing an update. This allows you to get feedback on your changes during
review.

The following steps will outline a basic flow for publishing a preview of your
changes, and then sharing it with your team. For a more comprehensive
resource, see the [Preview updates](/eas-update/preview) guide.

## Publish a preview of your changes

You can publish a preview of your current changes by running the following
[EAS CLI](/develop/tools#eas-cli) command:

Terminal

Copy

`- ``eas update --auto`

This command will publish an update under the current branch name.

## Share with your team

Once the preview is published, you'll see output like this in the terminal
window:

Terminal

`âœ” Published!`  
`...``EAS Dashboard https://expo.dev/accounts/your-account/projects/your-
project/updates/708b05d8-9bcf-4212-a052-ce40583b04fd`

Share the EAS dashboard link with a reviewer. After opening the link, they can
click on the Preview button. They will see a QR code that they can scan to
open the preview on their device.

## Create previews automatically

You can automatically create previews on every commit with [EAS
Workflows](/eas/workflows/get-started). First, you'll need to [configure your
project](/eas/workflows/get-started#configure-your-project), add a file named
.eas/workflows/publish-preview-update.yml at the root of your project, then
add the following workflow configuration:

.eas/workflows/publish-preview-update.yml

Copy

    
    
    name: Publish preview update
    
    on:
      push:
        branches: ['*']
    
    jobs:
      publish_preview_update:
        name: Publish preview update
        type: update
        params:
          branch: ${{ github.ref_name || 'test' }}
    

The workflow above will publish an update on every commit to every branch. You
can also run this workflow manually with the following EAS CLI command:

Terminal

Copy

`- ``eas workflow:run publish-preview-update.yml`

guide](/eas/workflows/examples).
