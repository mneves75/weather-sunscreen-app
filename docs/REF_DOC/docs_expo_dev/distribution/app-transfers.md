There are two different representations of your app to consider when handing
over ownership to another entity: the app as it exists on Expo Application
Services (to create builds with EAS Build, send updates with EAS Update, and
so on) and the app records on the app stores (to distribute the app to end-
users). The following guides explain how to handle app transfers in each case.
