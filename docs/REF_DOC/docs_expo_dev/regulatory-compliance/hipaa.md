## Are apps built with Expo HIPAA compliant?

They can be! You can build HIPAA compliant apps with Expo if you follow the
requirements.

Expo doesn't collect any individually identifiable health data, and you can
see all the data that Expo collects on [our privacy explained
page](https://expo.dev/privacy-explained). That being said, you are ultimately
in control of the data you collect from your users, so we cannot guarantee
that all apps built with Expo are HIPAA compliant, as in the end, it is up to
you as an individual application developer. But there should be no compliance
issues with using Expo.
