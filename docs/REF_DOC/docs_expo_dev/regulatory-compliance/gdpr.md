## Are apps built with Expo GDPR compliant?

They can be! You can build GDPR compliant apps with Expo if you follow the
requirements.

While Expo ensures the proper handling and processing of developer data and
end-user data, we cannot guarantee that the developers who build apps with
Expo follow similar data privacy practices themselves.
