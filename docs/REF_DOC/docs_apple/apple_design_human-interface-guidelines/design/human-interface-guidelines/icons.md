# Icons

An effective icon is a graphic asset that expresses a single concept in ways
people instantly understand.

Apps and games use a variety of simple icons to help people understand the
items, actions, and modes they can choose. Unlike [app icons](/design/human-
interface-guidelines/app-icons), which can use rich visual details like
shading, texturing, and highlighting to evoke the app’s personality, an
_interface icon_ typically uses streamlined shapes and touches of color to
communicate a straightforward idea.

You can design interface icons — also called _glyphs_ — or you can choose
symbols from the SF Symbols app, using them as-is or customizing them to suit
your needs. Both interface icons and symbols use black and clear colors to
define their shapes; the system can apply other colors to the black areas in
each image. For guidance, see [SF Symbols](/design/human-interface-
guidelines/sf-symbols).

## [Best practices](/design/human-interface-guidelines/icons#Best-practices)

**Create a recognizable, highly simplified design.** Too many details can make
an interface icon confusing or unreadable. Strive for a simple, universal
design that most people will recognize quickly. In general, icons work best
when they use familiar visual metaphors that are directly related to the
actions they initiate or content they represent.

**Maintain visual consistency across all interface icons in your app.**
Whether you use only custom icons or mix custom and system-provided ones, all
interface icons in your app need to use a consistent size, level of detail,
stroke thickness (or weight), and perspective. Depending on the visual weight
of an icon, you may need to adjust its dimensions to ensure that it appears
visually consistent with other icons.

To help achieve visual consistency, adjust individual icon sizes as necessary…

…and use the same stroke weight in every icon.

**In general, match the weights of interface icons and adjacent text.** Unless
you want to emphasize either the icons or the text, using the same weight for
both gives your content a consistent appearance and level of emphasis.

**If necessary, add padding to a custom interface icon to achieve optical
alignment.** Some icons — especially asymmetric ones — can look unbalanced
when you center them geometrically instead of optically. For example, the
download icon shown below has more visual weight on the bottom than on the
top, which can make it look too low if it’s geometrically centered.

An asymmetric icon can look off center even though it’s not.

In such cases, you can slightly adjust the position of the icon until it’s
optically centered. When you create an asset that includes your adjustments as
padding around an interface icon (as shown below on the right), you can
optically center the icon by geometrically centering the asset.

Moving the icon a few pixels higher optically centers it; including the pixels
in padding simplifies centering.

Adjustments for optical centering are typically very small, but they can have
a big impact on your app’s appearance.

Before optical centering (left) and after optical centering (right).

**Provide a selected-state version of an interface icon only if necessary.**
You don’t need to provide selected and unselected appearances for an icon
that’s used in standard system components such as toolbars, tab bars, and
buttons. The system updates the visual appearance of the selected state
automatically.

In a toolbar, a selected icon receives the app’s accent color.

**Use inclusive images.** Consider how your icons can be understandable and
welcoming to everyone. Prefer depicting gender-neutral human figures and avoid
images that might be hard to recognize across different cultures or languages.
For guidance, see [Inclusion](/design/human-interface-guidelines/inclusion).

**Include text in your design only when it’s essential for conveying
meaning.** For example, using a character in an interface icon that represents
text formatting can be the most direct way to communicate the concept. If you
need to display individual characters in your icon, be sure to localize them.
If you need to suggest a passage of text, design an abstract representation of
it, and include a flipped version of the icon to use when the context is
right-to-left. For guidance, see [Right to left](/design/human-interface-
guidelines/right-to-left).

Create localized versions of an icon that displays individual characters.

Create a flipped version of an icon that suggests reading direction.

**If you create a custom interface icon, use a vector format like PDF or
SVG.** The system automatically scales a vector-based interface icon for high-
resolution displays, so you don’t need to provide high-resolution versions of
it. In contrast, PNG — used for app icons and other images that include
effects like shading, textures, and highlighting — doesn’t support scaling, so
you have to supply multiple versions for each PNG-based interface icon.
Alternatively, you can create a custom SF Symbol and specify a scale that
ensures the symbol’s emphasis matches adjacent text. For guidance, see [SF
Symbols](/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols).

**Provide alternative text labels for custom interface icons.** Alternative
text labels — or accessibility descriptions — aren’t visible, but they let
VoiceOver audibly describe what’s onscreen, simplifying navigation for people
with visual disabilities. For guidance, see [VoiceOver](/design/human-
interface-guidelines/voiceover).

**Avoid using replicas of Apple hardware products.** Hardware designs tend to
change frequently and can make your interface icons and other content appear
dated. If you must display Apple hardware, use only the images available in
[Apple Design Resources](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/) or the
SF Symbols that represent various Apple products.

## [Standard icons](/design/human-interface-guidelines/icons#Standard-icons)

For icons to represent common actions in [menus](/design/human-interface-
guidelines/menus), [toolbars](/design/human-interface-guidelines/toolbars),
[buttons](/design/human-interface-guidelines/buttons), and other places in
interfaces across Apple platforms, you can use these [SF
Symbols](/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols).

## [Platform considerations](/design/human-interface-
guidelines/icons#Platform-considerations)

 _No additional considerations for iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, or watchOS._

### [macOS](/design/human-interface-guidelines/icons#macOS)

#### [Document icons](/design/human-interface-guidelines/icons#Document-icons)

If your macOS app can use a custom document type, you can create a document
icon to represent it. Traditionally, a document icon looks like a piece of
paper with its top-right corner folded down. This distinctive appearance helps
people distinguish documents from apps and other content, even when icon sizes
are small.

If you don’t supply a document icon for a file type you support, macOS creates
one for you by compositing your app icon and the file’s extension onto the
canvas. For example, Preview uses a system-generated document icon to
represent JPG files.

![An image of the Preview document icon for a JPG file.](https://docs-
assets.developer.apple.com/published/bfe462604c63811cb542e7c0fc46185e/doc-
icon-generated%402x.png)

In some cases, it can make sense to create a set of document icons to
represent a range of file types your app handles. For example, Xcode uses
custom document icons to help people distinguish projects, AR objects, and
Swift code files.

![Image of an Xcode project document icon.](https://docs-
assets.developer.apple.com/published/8cd56a7291cd6b41fe391958f704c823/doc-

icon-custom-3%402x.png)

To create a custom document icon, you can supply any combination of background
fill, center image, and text. The system layers, positions, and masks these
elements as needed and composites them onto the familiar folded-corner icon
shape.

assets.developer.apple.com/published/d5da9148d27f60891780ab1a9546a111/doc-
icon-parts%402x.png)macOS composites the elements you supply to produce your
custom document icon.

[Apple Design Resources](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/#macos-
apps) provides a template you can use to create a custom background fill and
center image for a document icon. As you use this template, follow the
guidelines below.

**Design simple images that clearly communicate the document type.** Whether
you use a background fill, a center image, or both, prefer uncomplicated
shapes and a reduced palette of distinct colors. Your document icon can
display as small as 16x16 px, so you want to create designs that remain
recognizable at every size.

**Designing a single, expressive image for the background fill can be a great
way to help people understand and recognize a document type.** For example,
Xcode and TextEdit both use rich background images that don’t include a center
image.

![Image of an Xcode project document icon.](https://docs-
assets.developer.apple.com/published/8cd56a7291cd6b41fe391958f704c823/doc-
icon-custom-1%402x.png)

![Image of a TextEdit rich text document icon.](https://docs-
assets.developer.apple.com/published/f32709a5ff5742e79fd03a58ae1dd9c6/doc-
icon-fill-only%402x.png)

**Consider reducing complexity in the small versions of your document icon.**
Icon details that are clear in large versions can look blurry and be hard to
recognize in small versions. For example, to ensure that the grid lines in the
custom heart document icon remain clear in intermediate sizes, you might use
fewer lines and thicken them by aligning them to the reduced pixel grid. In
the 16x16 px size, you might remove the lines altogether.

![Pixelated image of the heart document icon. The grid, the EKG line, the
heart shape, and the word heart are visible but blurry.](https://docs-
assets.developer.apple.com/published/1f8bc7946a75363224f373924b557a3a/doc-
icon-fewer-details-1%402x.png)The 32x32 px icon has fewer grid lines and a
thicker EKG line.

![Pixelated image of the heart document icon, in which only the blurry heart
shape and EKG line are visible.](https://docs-
assets.developer.apple.com/published/e46ac887801d9a16393948c3f2098715/doc-
icon-fewer-details-2%402x.png)The 16x16 px @2x icon retains the EKG line but
has no grid lines.

![Pixelated image of the heart document icon, in which only the blurry heart
shape is visible.](https://docs-
assets.developer.apple.com/published/fd0d2afcd76a9b25c1217ef2ffb1ad0e/doc-
icon-fewer-details-3%402x.png)The 16x16 px @1x icon has no EKG line and no
grid lines.

**Avoid placing important content in the top-right corner of your background
fill.** The system automatically masks your image to fit the document icon
shape and draws the white folded corner on top of the fill. Create a set of
background images in the sizes listed below.

  * 512x512 px @1x, 1024x1024 px @2x

  * 256x256 px @1x, 512x512 px @2x

  * 128x128 px @1x, 256x256 px @2x

  * 32x32 px @1x, 64x64 px @2x

  * 16x16 px @1x, 32x32 px @2x

**If a familiar object can convey a document’s type or its connection with
your app, consider creating a center image that depicts it.** Design a simple,
unambiguous image that’s clear and recognizable at every size. The center
image measures half the size of the overall document icon canvas. For example,
to create a center image for a 32x32 px document icon, use an image canvas
that measures 16x16 px. You can provide center images in the following sizes:

  * 256x256 px @1x, 512x512 px @2x

  * 128x128 px @1x, 256x256 px @2x

  * 32x32 px @1x, 64x64 px @2x

  * 16x16 px @1x, 32x32 px @2x

**Define a margin that measures about 10% of the image canvas and keep most of
the image within it.** Although parts of the image can extend into this margin
for optical alignment, it’s best when the image occupies about 80% of the
image canvas. For example, most of the center image in a 256x256 px canvas
would fit in an area that measures 205x205 px.

![Diagram of the solid pink heart shape within blue margins that measure 10
percent of the canvas width.](https://docs-
assets.developer.apple.com/published/7cc19b2ae1e99d26ba69e1351683ede1/doc-
icon-parts-margins%402x.png)

**Specify a succinct term if it helps people understand your document type.**
By default, the system displays a document’s extension at the bottom edge of
the document icon, but if the extension is unfamiliar you can supply a more
descriptive term. For example, the document icon for a SceneKit scene file
uses the term _scene_ instead of the file extension _scn_. The system
automatically scales the extension text to fit in the document icon, so be
sure to use a term that’s short enough to be legible at small sizes. By
default, the system capitalizes every letter in the text.
