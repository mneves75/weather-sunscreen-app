# Rating indicators

A rating indicator uses a series of horizontally arranged graphical symbols —
by default, stars — to communicate a ranking level.

A rating indicator doesn’t display partial symbols; it rounds the value to
display complete symbols only. Within a rating indicator, symbols are always
the same distance apart and don’t expand or shrink to fit the component’s
width.

## [Best practices](/design/human-interface-guidelines/rating-indicators#Best-
practices)

**Make it easy to change rankings.** When presenting a list of ranked items,
let people adjust the rank of individual items inline without navigating to a
separate editing screen.

**If you replace the star with a custom symbol, make sure that its purpose is
clear.** The star is a very recognizable ranking symbol, and people may not
associate other symbols with a rating scale.

## [Platform considerations](/design/human-interface-guidelines/rating-
indicators#Platform-considerations)
