# Image wells

An image well is an editable version of an image view.

After selecting an image well, people can copy and paste its image or delete
it. People can also drag a new image into an image well without selecting it
first.

## [Best practices](/design/human-interface-guidelines/image-wells#Best-
practices)

**Revert to a default image when necessary.** If your image well requires an
image, display the default image again if people clear the content of the
image well.

**If your image well supports copy and paste, make sure the standard copy and
paste menu items are available.** People generally expect to choose these menu
items — or use the standard keyboard shortcuts — to interact with an image
well. For guidance, see [Edit menu](/design/human-interface-guidelines/the-
menu-bar#Edit-menu).

guidelines/image-views).
