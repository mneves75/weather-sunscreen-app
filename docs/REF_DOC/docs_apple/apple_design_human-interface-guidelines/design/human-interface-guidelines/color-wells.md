# Color wells

A color well lets people adjust the color of text, shapes, guides, and other
onscreen elements.

A color well displays a color picker when people tap or click it. This color
picker can be the system-provided one or a custom interface that you design.

## [Best practices](/design/human-interface-guidelines/color-wells#Best-
practices)

**Consider the system-provided color picker for a familiar experience.** Using
the built-in color picker provides a consistent experience, in addition to
letting people save a set of colors they can access from any app. The system-
defined color picker can also help provide a familiar experience when
developing apps across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.

## [Platform considerations](/design/human-interface-guidelines/color-
wells#Platform-considerations)

 _No additional considerations for iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS. Not supported in
tvOS or watchOS._

### [macOS](/design/human-interface-guidelines/color-wells#macOS)

When people click a color well, it receives a highlight to provide visual
confirmation that it’s active. It then opens a color picker so people can
choose a color. After they make a selection, the color well updates to show
the new color.

Color wells also support drag and drop, so people can drag colors from one
color well to another, and from the color picker to a color well.
