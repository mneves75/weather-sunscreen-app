# Human Interface Guidelines

The HIG contains guidance and best practices that can help you design a great
experience for any Apple platform.

As you design interfaces for Apple platforms, keep these principles in mind:

#### [Hierarchy](/design/human-interface-guidelines#Hierarchy)

Establish a clear visual hierarchy where controls and interface elements
elevate and distinguish the content beneath them.

#### [Harmony](/design/human-interface-guidelines#Harmony)

Align with the concentric design of the hardware and software to create
harmony between interface elements, system experiences, and devices.

#### [Consistency](/design/human-interface-guidelines#Consistency)

Adopt platform conventions to maintain a consistent design that continuously
adapts across window sizes and displays.

For developer guidance, see [Adopting Liquid
Glass](/documentation/TechnologyOverviews/adopting-liquid-glass).
