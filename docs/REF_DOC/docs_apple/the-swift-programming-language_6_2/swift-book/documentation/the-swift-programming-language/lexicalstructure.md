  * Lexical Structure 

# Lexical Structure

Use the lowest-level components of the syntax.

The _lexical structure_ of Swift describes what sequence of characters form
valid tokens of the language. These valid tokens form the lowest-level
building blocks of the language and are used to describe the rest of the
language in subsequent chapters. A token consists of an identifier, keyword,
punctuation, literal, or operator.

In most cases, tokens are generated from the characters of a Swift source file
by considering the longest possible substring from the input text, within the
constraints of the grammar that are specified below. This behavior is referred
to as _longest match_ or _maximal munch_.

## [Whitespace and Comments](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/lexicalstructure/#Whitespace-and-Comments)

Whitespace has two uses: to separate tokens in the source file and to
distinguish between prefix, postfix, and infix operators (see
[Operators](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/lexicalstructure#Operators)), but is otherwise ignored. The following
characters are considered whitespace: space (U+0020), line feed (U+000A),
carriage return (U+000D), horizontal tab (U+0009), vertical tab (U+000B), form
feed (U+000C) and null (U+0000).

Comments are treated as whitespace by the compiler. Single line comments begin
with `//` and continue until a line feed (U+000A) or carriage return (U+000D).
Multiline comments begin with `/*` and end with `*/`. Nesting multiline
comments is allowed, but the comment markers must be balanced.

Comments can contain additional formatting and markup, as described in [Markup
Formatting
Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/index.html).

_multiline-comment-text-item_ → Any Unicode scalar value except **`/*`** or

## [Identifiers](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/lexicalstructure/#Identifiers)

 _Identifiers_ begin with an uppercase or lowercase letter A through Z, an
underscore (`_`), a noncombining alphanumeric Unicode character in the Basic
Multilingual Plane, or a character outside the Basic Multilingual Plane that
isn’t in a Private Use Area. After the first character, digits and combining
Unicode characters are also allowed.

Treat identifiers that begin with an underscore, subscripts whose first
argument label begins with an underscore, and initializers whose first
argument label begins with an underscore, as internal, even if their
declaration has the `public` access-level modifier. This convention lets
framework authors mark part of an API that clients must not interact with or
depend on, even though some limitation requires the declaration to be public.
In addition, identifiers that begin with two underscores are reserved for the
Swift compiler and standard library.

To use a reserved word as an identifier, put a backtick (`) before and after
it. For example, `class` isn’t a valid identifier, but ``class`` is valid. The
backticks aren’t considered part of the identifier; ``x`` and `x` have the
same meaning.

Inside a closure with no explicit parameter names, the parameters are
implicitly named `$0`, `$1`, `$2`, and so on. These names are valid
identifiers within the scope of the closure.

The compiler synthesizes identifiers that begin with a dollar sign (`$`) for
properties that have a property wrapper projection. Your code can interact
with these identifiers, but you can’t declare identifiers with that prefix.
For more information, see the [propertyWrapper](/swift-book/documentation/the-
swift-programming-language/attributes#propertyWrapper) section of the
[Attributes](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/attributes) chapter.

## [Keywords and Punctuation](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/lexicalstructure/#Keywords-and-Punctuation)

The following keywords are reserved and can’t be used as identifiers, unless
they’re escaped with backticks, as described above in [Identifiers](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/lexicalstructure#Identifiers). Keywords other than `inout`, `var`,
and `let` can be used as parameter names in a function declaration or function
call without being escaped with backticks. When a member has the same name as
a keyword, references to that member don’t need to be escaped with backticks,
except when there’s ambiguity between referring to the member and using the
keyword — for example, `self`, `Type`, and `Protocol` have special meaning in
an explicit member expression, so they must be escaped with backticks in that
context.

  * Keywords used in declarations: `associatedtype`, `borrowing`, `class`, `consuming`, `deinit`, `enum`, `extension`, `fileprivate`, `func`, `import`, `init`, `inout`, `internal`, `let`, `nonisolated`, `open`, `operator`, `precedencegroup`, `private`, `protocol`, `public`, `rethrows`, `static`, `struct`, `subscript`, `typealias`, and `var`.

  * Keywords used in statements: `break`, `case`, `catch`, `continue`, `default`, `defer`, `do`, `else`, `fallthrough`, `for`, `guard`, `if`, `in`, `repeat`, `return`, `switch`, `throw`, `where`, and `while`.

  * Keywords used in expressions and types: `Any`, `as`, `await`, `catch`, `false`, `is`, `nil`, `rethrows`, `self`, `Self`, `super`, `throw`, `throws`, `true`, and `try`.

  * Keywords used in patterns: `_`.

  * Keywords that begin with a number sign (`#`): `#available`, `#colorLiteral`, `#else`, `#elseif`, `#endif`, `#fileLiteral`, `#if`, `#imageLiteral`, `#keyPath`, `#selector`, `#sourceLocation`, `#unavailable`.

Note

Prior to Swift 5.9, the following keywords were reserved: `#column`,
`#dsohandle`, `#error`, `#fileID`, `#filePath`, `#file`, `#function`, `#line`,
and `#warning`. These are now implemented as macros in the Swift standard
library:
[`column`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/column\(\)),
[`dsohandle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/dsohandle\(\)),
[`error(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/error\(_:\)),
[`fileID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/fileID\(\)),
[`filePath`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/filePath\(\)),
[`file`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/file\(\)),
[`function`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/function\(\)),
[`line`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/line\(\)), and
[`warning(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/warning\(_:\)).

  * Keywords reserved in particular contexts: `associativity`, `async`, `convenience`, `didSet`, `dynamic`, `final`, `get`, `indirect`, `infix`, `lazy`, `left`, `mutating`, `none`, `nonmutating`, `optional`, `override`, `package`, `postfix`, `precedence`, `prefix`, `Protocol`, `required`, `right`, `set`, `some`, `Type`, `unowned`, `weak`, and `willSet`. Outside the context in which they appear in the grammar, they can be used as identifiers.

The following tokens are reserved as punctuation and can’t be used as custom
operators: `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `.`, `,`, `:`, `;`, `=`, `@`, `#`,
`&` (as a prefix operator), `->`, ```, `?`, and `!` (as a postfix operator).

## [Literals](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/lexicalstructure/#Literals)

A _literal_ is the source code representation of a value of a type, such as a
number or string.

The following are examples of literals:

    
    
    42               // Integer literal
    3.14159          // Floating-point literal
    "Hello, world!"  // String literal
    /Hello, .*/      // Regular expression literal
    true             // Boolean literal
    

A literal doesn’t have a type on its own. Instead, a literal is parsed as
having infinite precision and Swift’s type inference attempts to infer a type
for the literal. For example, in the declaration `let x: Int8 = 42`, Swift
uses the explicit type annotation (`: Int8`) to infer that the type of the
integer literal `42` is `Int8`. If there isn’t suitable type information
available, Swift infers that the literal’s type is one of the default literal
types defined in the Swift standard library and listed in the table below.
When specifying the type annotation for a literal value, the annotation’s type
must be a type that can be instantiated from that literal value. That is, the
type must conform to the Swift standard library protocols listed in the table
below.

Literal| Default type| Protocol  
---|---|---  
Integer| `Int`| `ExpressibleByIntegerLiteral`  
Floating-point| `Double`| `ExpressibleByFloatLiteral`  
String| `String`| `ExpressibleByStringLiteral`,
`ExpressibleByUnicodeScalarLiteral` for string literals that contain only a
single Unicode scalar, `ExpressibleByExtendedGraphemeClusterLiteral` for
string literals that contain only a single extended grapheme cluster  
Regular expression| `Regex`| None  
Boolean| `Bool`| `ExpressibleByBooleanLiteral`  
  
For example, in the declaration `let str = "Hello, world"`, the default
inferred type of the string literal `"Hello, world"` is `String`. Also, `Int8`
conforms to the `ExpressibleByIntegerLiteral` protocol, and therefore it can
be used in the type annotation for the integer literal `42` in the declaration
`let x: Int8 = 42`.

Grammar of a literal

 _literal_ → _numeric-literal_ | _string-literal_ | _regular-expression-literal_ | _boolean-literal_ | _nil-literal_

 _numeric-literal_ → **`-`**_?_ _integer-literal_ | **`-`**_?_ _floating-point-literal_   
_boolean-literal_ → **`true`** | **`false`**   
_nil-literal_ → **`nil`**

### [Integer Literals](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/lexicalstructure/#Integer-Literals)

 _Integer literals_ represent integer values of unspecified precision. By
default, integer literals are expressed in decimal; you can specify an
alternate base using a prefix. Binary literals begin with `0b`, octal literals
begin with `0o`, and hexadecimal literals begin with `0x`.

Decimal literals contain the digits `0` through `9`. Binary literals contain
`0` and `1`, octal literals contain `0` through `7`, and hexadecimal literals
contain `0` through `9` as well as `A` through `F` in upper- or lowercase.

Negative integers literals are expressed by prepending a minus sign (`-`) to
an integer literal, as in `-42`.

Underscores (`_`) are allowed between digits for readability, but they’re
ignored and therefore don’t affect the value of the literal. Integer literals
can begin with leading zeros (`0`), but they’re likewise ignored and don’t
affect the base or value of the literal.

Unless otherwise specified, the default inferred type of an integer literal is
the Swift standard library type `Int`. The Swift standard library also defines
types for various sizes of signed and unsigned integers, as described in
[Integers](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/thebasics#Integers).

### [Floating-Point Literals](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/lexicalstructure/#Floating-Point-Literals)

 _Floating-point literals_ represent floating-point values of unspecified
precision.

By default, floating-point literals are expressed in decimal (with no prefix),
but they can also be expressed in hexadecimal (with a `0x` prefix).

Decimal floating-point literals consist of a sequence of decimal digits
followed by either a decimal fraction, a decimal exponent, or both. The
decimal fraction consists of a decimal point (`.`) followed by a sequence of
decimal digits. The exponent consists of an upper- or lowercase `e` prefix
followed by a sequence of decimal digits that indicates what power of 10 the
value preceding the `e` is multiplied by. For example, `1.25e2` represents
1.25 x 10², which evaluates to `125.0`. Similarly, `1.25e-2` represents 1.25 x
10⁻², which evaluates to `0.0125`.

Hexadecimal floating-point literals consist of a `0x` prefix, followed by an
optional hexadecimal fraction, followed by a hexadecimal exponent. The
hexadecimal fraction consists of a decimal point followed by a sequence of
hexadecimal digits. The exponent consists of an upper- or lowercase `p` prefix
followed by a sequence of decimal digits that indicates what power of 2 the
value preceding the `p` is multiplied by. For example, `0xFp2` represents 15 x
2², which evaluates to `60`. Similarly, `0xFp-2` represents 15 x 2⁻², which
evaluates to `3.75`.

Negative floating-point literals are expressed by prepending a minus sign
(`-`) to a floating-point literal, as in `-42.5`.

Underscores (`_`) are allowed between digits for readability, but they’re
ignored and therefore don’t affect the value of the literal. Floating-point
literals can begin with leading zeros (`0`), but they’re likewise ignored and
don’t affect the base or value of the literal.

Unless otherwise specified, the default inferred type of a floating-point
literal is the Swift standard library type `Double`, which represents a 64-bit
floating-point number. The Swift standard library also defines a `Float` type,
which represents a 32-bit floating-point number.

_sign_ → **`+`** | **`-`**

### [String Literals](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/lexicalstructure/#String-Literals)

A string literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotation marks. A
single-line string literal is surrounded by double quotation marks and has the
following form:

    
    
    "<#characters#>"
    

String literals can’t contain an unescaped double quotation mark (`"`), an
unescaped backslash (`\`), a carriage return, or a line feed.

A multiline string literal is surrounded by three double quotation marks and
has the following form:

    
    
    """
    <#characters#>
    """
    

Unlike a single-line string literal, a multiline string literal can contain
unescaped double quotation marks (`"`), carriage returns, and line feeds. It
can’t contain three unescaped double quotation marks next to each other.

The line break after the `"""` that begins the multiline string literal isn’t
part of the string. The line break before the `"""` that ends the literal is
also not part of the string. To make a multiline string literal that begins or
ends with a line feed, write a blank line as its first or last line.

A multiline string literal can be indented using any combination of spaces and
tabs; this indentation isn’t included in the string. The `"""` that ends the
literal determines the indentation: Every nonblank line in the literal must
begin with exactly the same indentation that appears before the closing `"""`;
there’s no conversion between tabs and spaces. You can include additional
spaces and tabs after that indentation; those spaces and tabs appear in the
string.

Line breaks in a multiline string literal are normalized to use the line feed
character. Even if your source file has a mix of carriage returns and line
feeds, all of the line breaks in the string will be the same.

In a multiline string literal, writing a backslash (`\`) at the end of a line
omits that line break from the string. Any whitespace between the backslash
and the line break is also omitted. You can use this syntax to hard wrap a
multiline string literal in your source code, without changing the value of
the resulting string.

Special characters can be included in string literals of both the single-line
and multiline forms using the following escape sequences:

  * Null character (`\0`)

  * Backslash (`\\`)

  * Horizontal tab (`\t`)

  * Line feed (`\n`)

  * Carriage return (`\r`)

  * Double quotation mark (`\"`)

  * Single quotation mark (`\'`)

  * Unicode scalar (`\u{`_n_`}`), where _n_ is a hexadecimal number that has one to eight digits

The value of an expression can be inserted into a string literal by placing
the expression in parentheses after a backslash (`\`). The interpolated
expression can contain a string literal, but can’t contain an unescaped
backslash, a carriage return, or a line feed.

For example, all of the following string literals have the same value:

    
    
    "1 2 3"
    "1 2 \("3")"
    "1 2 \(3)"
    "1 2 \(1 + 2)"
    let x = 3; "1 2 \(x)"
    

A string delimited by extended delimiters is a sequence of characters
surrounded by quotation marks and a balanced set of one or more number signs
(`#`). A string delimited by extended delimiters has the following forms:

    
    
    #"<#characters#>"#
    
    
    #"""
    <#characters#>
    """#
    

Special characters in a string delimited by extended delimiters appear in the
resulting string as normal characters rather than as special characters. You
can use extended delimiters to create strings with characters that would
ordinarily have a special effect such as generating a string interpolation,
starting an escape sequence, or terminating the string.

The following example shows a string literal and a string delimited by
extended delimiters that create equivalent string values:

    
    
    let string = #"\(x) \ " \u{2603}"#
    let escaped = "\\(x) \\ \" \\u{2603}"
    print(string)
    // Prints "\(x) \ " \u{2603}"
    print(string == escaped)
    // Prints "true"
    

If you use more than one number sign to form a string delimited by extended
delimiters, don’t place whitespace in between the number signs:

    
    
    print(###"Line 1\###nLine 2"###) // OK
    print(# # #"Line 1\# # #nLine 2"# # #) // Error
    

Multiline string literals that you create using extended delimiters have the
same indentation requirements as regular multiline string literals.

The default inferred type of a string literal is `String`. For more
information about the `String` type, see [Strings and Characters](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/stringsandcharacters) and
[`String`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string).

String literals that are concatenated by the `+` operator are concatenated at
compile time. For example, the values of `textA` and `textB` in the example
below are identical — no runtime concatenation is performed.

    
    
    let textA = "Hello " + "world"
    let textB = "Hello world"

A regular expression literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by slashes
(`/`) with the following form:

    
    
    /<#regular expression#>/
    

Regular expression literals must not begin with an unescaped tab or space, and
they can’t contain an unescaped slash (`/`), a carriage return, or a line
feed.

Within a regular expression literal, a backslash is understood as a part of
that regular expression, not just as an escape character like in string
literals. It indicates that the following special character should be
interpreted literally, or that the following nonspecial character should be
interpreted in a special way. For example, `/\(/` matches a single left
parenthesis and `/\d/` matches a single digit.

A regular expression literal delimited by extended delimiters is a sequence of
characters surrounded by slashes (`/`) and a balanced set of one or more
number signs (`#`). A regular expression literal delimited by extended
delimiters has the following forms:

    
    
    #/<#regular expression#>/#
    
    
    #/
    <#regular expression#>
    /#
    

A regular expression literal that uses extended delimiters can begin with an
unescaped space or tab, contain unescaped slashes (`/`), and span across
multiple lines. For a multiline regular expression literal, the opening
delimiter must be at the end of a line, and the closing delimiter must be on
its own line. Inside a multiline regular expression literal, the extended
regular expression syntax is enabled by default — specifically, whitespace is
ignored and comments are allowed.

If you use more than one number sign to form a regular expression literal
delimited by extended delimiters, don’t place whitespace in between the number
signs:

    
    
    let regex1 = ##/abc/##       // OK
    let regex2 = # #/abc/# #     // Error
    

If you need to make an empty regular expression literal, you must use the
extended delimiter syntax.

## [Operators](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/lexicalstructure/#Operators)

The Swift standard library defines a number of operators for your use, many of
which are discussed in [Basic Operators](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/basicoperators) and [Advanced Operators](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/advancedoperators). The
present section describes which characters can be used to define custom
operators.

Custom operators can begin with one of the ASCII characters `/`, `=`, `-`,
`+`, `!`, `*`, `%`, `<`, `>`, `&`, `|`, `^`, `?`, or `~`, or one of the
Unicode characters defined in the grammar below (which include characters from
the _Mathematical Operators_ , _Miscellaneous Symbols_ , and _Dingbats_
Unicode blocks, among others). After the first character, combining Unicode
characters are also allowed.

You can also define custom operators that begin with a dot (`.`). These
operators can contain additional dots. For example, `.+.` is treated as a
single operator. If an operator doesn’t begin with a dot, it can’t contain a
dot elsewhere. For example, `+.+` is treated as the `+` operator followed by
the `.+` operator.

Although you can define custom operators that contain a question mark (`?`),
they can’t consist of a single question mark character only. Additionally,
although operators can contain an exclamation point (`!`), postfix operators
can’t begin with either a question mark or an exclamation point.

Note

The tokens `=`, `->`, `//`, `/*`, `*/`, `.`, the prefix operators `<`, `&`,
and `?`, the infix operator `?`, and the postfix operators `>`, `!`, and `?`
are reserved. These tokens can’t be overloaded, nor can they be used as custom
operators.

The whitespace around an operator is used to determine whether an operator is
used as a prefix operator, a postfix operator, or an infix operator. This
behavior has the following rules:

  * If an operator has whitespace around both sides or around neither side, it’s treated as an infix operator. As an example, the `+++` operator in `a+++b` and `a +++ b` is treated as an infix operator.

  * If an operator has whitespace on the left side only, it’s treated as a prefix unary operator. As an example, the `+++` operator in `a +++b` is treated as a prefix unary operator.

  * If an operator has whitespace on the right side only, it’s treated as a postfix unary operator. As an example, the `+++` operator in `a+++ b` is treated as a postfix unary operator.

  * If an operator has no whitespace on the left but is followed immediately by a dot (`.`), it’s treated as a postfix unary operator. As an example, the `+++` operator in `a+++.b` is treated as a postfix unary operator (`a+++ .b` rather than `a +++ .b`).

For the purposes of these rules, the characters `(`, `[`, and `{` before an
operator, the characters `)`, `]`, and `}` after an operator, and the
characters `,`, `;`, and `:` are also considered whitespace.

If the `!` or `?` predefined operator has no whitespace on the left, it’s
treated as a postfix operator, regardless of whether it has whitespace on the
right. To use the `?` as the optional-chaining operator, it must not have
whitespace on the left. To use it in the ternary conditional (`?` `:`)
operator, it must have whitespace around both sides.

If one of the arguments to an infix operator is a regular expression literal,
then the operator must have whitespace around both sides.

In certain constructs, operators with a leading `<` or `>` may be split into
two or more tokens. The remainder is treated the same way and may be split
again. As a result, you don’t need to add whitespace to disambiguate between
the closing `>` characters in constructs like `Dictionary<String,
Array<Int>>`. In this example, the closing `>` characters aren’t treated as a
single token that may then be misinterpreted as a bit shift `>>` operator.

To learn how to define new, custom operators, see [Custom Operators](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/advancedoperators#Custom-
Operators) and [Operator Declaration](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-

overload existing operators, see [Operator Methods](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/advancedoperators#Operator-
Methods).
