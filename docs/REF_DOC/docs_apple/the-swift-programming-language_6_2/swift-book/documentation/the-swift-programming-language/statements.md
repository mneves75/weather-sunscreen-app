# Statements

Group expressions and control the flow of execution.

In Swift, there are three kinds of statements: simple statements, compiler
control statements, and control flow statements. Simple statements are the
most common and consist of either an expression or a declaration. Compiler
control statements allow the program to change aspects of the compiler’s
behavior and include a conditional compilation block and a line control
statement.

Control flow statements are used to control the flow of execution in a
program. There are several types of control flow statements in Swift,
including loop statements, branch statements, and control transfer statements.
Loop statements allow a block of code to be executed repeatedly, branch
statements allow a certain block of code to be executed only when certain
conditions are met, and control transfer statements provide a way to alter the
order in which code is executed. In addition, Swift provides a `do` statement
to introduce scope, and catch and handle errors, and a `defer` statement for
running cleanup actions just before the current scope exits.

A semicolon (`;`) can optionally appear after any statement and is used to
separate multiple statements if they appear on the same line.

## [Loop Statements](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements/#Loop-Statements)

Loop statements allow a block of code to be executed repeatedly, depending on
the conditions specified in the loop. Swift has three loop statements: a
`for`-`in` statement, a `while` statement, and a `repeat`-`while` statement.

Control flow in a loop statement can be changed by a `break` statement and a
`continue` statement and is discussed in [Break Statement](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/statements#Break-Statement)
and [Continue Statement](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements#Continue-Statement) below.

Grammar of a loop statement

 _loop-statement_ → _for-in-statement_  
_loop-statement_ → _while-statement_  
_loop-statement_ → _repeat-while-statement_

### [For-In Statement](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements/#For-In-Statement)

A `for`-`in` statement allows a block of code to be executed once for each
item in a collection (or any type) that conforms to the
[`Sequence`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sequence)
protocol.

A `for`-`in` statement has the following form:

    
    
    for <#item#> in <#collection#> {
       <#statements#>
    }
    

The `makeIterator()` method is called on the _collection_ expression to obtain
a value of an iterator type — that is, a type that conforms to the
[`IteratorProtocol`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/iteratorprotocol)
protocol. The program begins executing a loop by calling the `next()` method
on the iterator. If the value returned isn’t `nil`, it’s assigned to the
_item_ pattern, the program executes the _statements_ , and then continues
execution at the beginning of the loop. Otherwise, the program doesn’t perform
assignment or execute the _statements_ , and it’s finished executing the
`for`-`in` statement.

Grammar of a for-in statement

 _for-in-statement_ → **`for`** **`case`** _?_ _pattern_ **`in`** _expression_
_where-clause_ _?_ _code-block_

### [While Statement](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements/#While-Statement)

A `while` statement allows a block of code to be executed repeatedly, as long
as a condition remains true.

A `while` statement has the following form:

    
    
    while <#condition#> {
       <#statements#>
    }
    

A `while` statement is executed as follows:

  1. The _condition_ is evaluated.

If `true`, execution continues to step 2. If `false`, the program is finished
executing the `while` statement.

  2. The program executes the _statements_ , and execution returns to step 1.

Because the value of the _condition_ is evaluated before the _statements_ are
executed, the _statements_ in a `while` statement can be executed zero or more
times.

The value of the _condition_ must be of type `Bool` or a type bridged to
`Bool`. The condition can also be an optional binding declaration, as
discussed in [Optional Binding](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/thebasics#Optional-Binding).

Grammar of a while statement

 _while-statement_ → **`while`** _condition-list_ _code-block_

 _condition-list_ → _condition_ | _condition_ **`,`** _condition-list_   
_condition_ → _expression_ | _availability-condition_ | _case-condition_ | _optional-binding-condition_

 _case-condition_ → **`case`** _pattern_ _initializer_  
_optional-binding-condition_ → **`let`** _pattern_ _initializer_ _?_ | **`var`** _pattern_ _initializer_ _?_

### [Repeat-While Statement](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements/#Repeat-While-Statement)

A `repeat`-`while` statement allows a block of code to be executed one or more
times, as long as a condition remains true.

A `repeat`-`while` statement has the following form:

    
    
    repeat {
       <#statements#>
    } while <#condition#>
    

A `repeat`-`while` statement is executed as follows:

  1. The program executes the _statements_ , and execution continues to step 2.

  2. The _condition_ is evaluated.

If `true`, execution returns to step 1. If `false`, the program is finished
executing the `repeat`-`while` statement.

Because the value of the _condition_ is evaluated after the _statements_ are
executed, the _statements_ in a `repeat`-`while` statement are executed at
least once.

The value of the _condition_ must be of type `Bool` or a type bridged to
`Bool`.

Grammar of a repeat-while statement

 _repeat-while-statement_ → **`repeat`** _code-block_ **`while`** _expression_

## [Branch Statements](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements/#Branch-Statements)

Branch statements allow the program to execute certain parts of code depending
on the value of one or more conditions. The values of the conditions specified
in a branch statement control how the program branches and, therefore, what
block of code is executed. Swift has three branch statements: an `if`
statement, a `guard` statement, and a `switch` statement.

Control flow in an `if` statement or a `switch` statement can be changed by a
`break` statement and is discussed in [Break Statement](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/statements#Break-Statement)
below.

Grammar of a branch statement

 _branch-statement_ → _if-statement_  
_branch-statement_ → _guard-statement_  
_branch-statement_ → _switch-statement_

### [If Statement](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements/#If-Statement)

An `if` statement is used for executing code based on the evaluation of one or
more conditions.

There are two basic forms of an `if` statement. In each form, the opening and
closing braces are required.

The first form allows code to be executed only when a condition is true and
has the following form:

    
    
    if <#condition#> {
       <#statements#>
    }
    

The second form of an `if` statement provides an additional _else clause_
(introduced by the `else` keyword) and is used for executing one part of code
when the condition is true and another part of code when the same condition is
false. When a single else clause is present, an `if` statement has the
following form:

    
    
    if <#condition#> {
       <#statements to execute if condition is true#>
    } else {
       <#statements to execute if condition is false#>
    }
    

The else clause of an `if` statement can contain another `if` statement to
test more than one condition. An `if` statement chained together in this way
has the following form:

    
    
    if <#condition 1#> {
       <#statements to execute if condition 1 is true#>
    } else if <#condition 2#> {
       <#statements to execute if condition 2 is true#>
    } else {
       <#statements to execute if both conditions are false#>
    }
    

The value of any condition in an `if` statement must be of type `Bool` or a
type bridged to `Bool`. The condition can also be an optional binding
declaration, as discussed in [Optional Binding](/swift-book/documentation/the-
swift-programming-language/thebasics#Optional-Binding).

Grammar of an if statement

 _if-statement_ → **`if`** _condition-list_ _code-block_ _else-clause_ _?_  
_else-clause_ → **`else`** _code-block_ | **`else`** _if-statement_

### [Guard Statement](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements/#Guard-Statement)

A `guard` statement is used to transfer program control out of a scope if one
or more conditions aren’t met.

A `guard` statement has the following form:

    
    
    guard <#condition#> else {
       <#statements#>
    }
    

The value of any condition in a `guard` statement must be of type `Bool` or a
type bridged to `Bool`. The condition can also be an optional binding
declaration, as discussed in [Optional Binding](/swift-book/documentation/the-
swift-programming-language/thebasics#Optional-Binding).

Any constants or variables assigned a value from an optional binding
declaration in a `guard` statement condition can be used for the rest of the
guard statement’s enclosing scope.

The `else` clause of a `guard` statement is required, and must either call a
function with the `Never` return type or transfer program control outside the
guard statement’s enclosing scope using one of the following statements:

  * `return`

  * `break`

  * `continue`

  * `throw`

Control transfer statements are discussed in [Control Transfer
Statements](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements#Control-Transfer-Statements) below. For more information
on functions with the `Never` return type, see [Functions that Never
Return](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/declarations#Functions-that-Never-Return).

Grammar of a guard statement

 _guard-statement_ → **`guard`** _condition-list_ **`else`** _code-block_

### [Switch Statement](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements/#Switch-Statement)

A `switch` statement allows certain blocks of code to be executed depending on
the value of a control expression.

A `switch` statement has the following form:

    
    
    switch <#control expression#> {
    case <#pattern 1#>:
        <#statements#>
    case <#pattern 2#> where <#condition#>:
        <#statements#>
    case <#pattern 3#> where <#condition#>,
        <#pattern 4#> where <#condition#>:
        <#statements#>
    default:
        <#statements#>
    }
    

The _control expression_ of the `switch` statement is evaluated and then
compared with the patterns specified in each case. If a match is found, the
program executes the _statements_ listed within the scope of that case. The
scope of each case can’t be empty. As a result, you must include at least one
statement following the colon (`:`) of each case label. Use a single `break`
statement if you don’t intend to execute any code in the body of a matched
case.

The values of expressions your code can branch on are very flexible. For
example, in addition to the values of scalar types, such as integers and
characters, your code can branch on the values of any type, including
floating-point numbers, strings, tuples, instances of custom classes, and
optionals. The value of the _control expression_ can even be matched to the
value of a case in an enumeration and checked for inclusion in a specified
range of values. For examples of how to use these various types of values in
`switch` statements, see [Switch](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/controlflow#Switch) in [Control Flow](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/controlflow).

A `switch` case can optionally contain a `where` clause after each pattern. A
_where clause_ is introduced by the `where` keyword followed by an expression,
and is used to provide an additional condition before a pattern in a case is
considered matched to the _control expression_. If a `where` clause is
present, the _statements_ within the relevant case are executed only if the
value of the _control expression_ matches one of the patterns of the case and
the expression of the `where` clause evaluates to `true`. For example, a
_control expression_ matches the case in the example below only if it’s a
tuple that contains two elements of the same value, such as `(1, 1)`.

    
    
    case let (x, y) where x == y:
    

As the above example shows, patterns in a case can also bind constants using
the `let` keyword (they can also bind variables using the `var` keyword).
These constants (or variables) can then be referenced in a corresponding
`where` clause and throughout the rest of the code within the scope of the
case. If the case contains multiple patterns that match the control
expression, all of the patterns must contain the same constant or variable
bindings, and each bound variable or constant must have the same type in all
of the case’s patterns.

A `switch` statement can also include a default case, introduced by the
`default` keyword. The code within a default case is executed only if no other
cases match the control expression. A `switch` statement can include only one
default case, which must appear at the end of the `switch` statement.

Although the actual execution order of pattern-matching operations, and in
particular the evaluation order of patterns in cases, is unspecified, pattern
matching in a `switch` statement behaves as if the evaluation is performed in
source order — that is, the order in which they appear in source code. As a
result, if multiple cases contain patterns that evaluate to the same value,
and thus can match the value of the control expression, the program executes
only the code within the first matching case in source order.

#### [Switch Statements Must Be Exhaustive](/swift-book/documentation/the-
swift-programming-language/statements/#Switch-Statements-Must-Be-Exhaustive)

In Swift, every possible value of the control expression’s type must match the
value of at least one pattern of a case. When this simply isn’t feasible (for
example, when the control expression’s type is `Int`), you can include a
default case to satisfy the requirement.

#### [Switching Over Future Enumeration Cases](/swift-book/documentation/the-
swift-programming-language/statements/#Switching-Over-Future-Enumeration-
Cases)

A _nonfrozen enumeration_ is a special kind of enumeration that may gain new
enumeration cases in the future — even after you compile and ship an app.
Switching over a nonfrozen enumeration requires extra consideration. When a
library’s authors mark an enumeration as nonfrozen, they reserve the right to
add new enumeration cases, and any code that interacts with that enumeration
_must_ be able to handle those future cases without being recompiled. Code
that’s compiled in library evolution mode, code in the Swift standard library,
Swift overlays for Apple frameworks, and C and Objective-C code can declare
nonfrozen enumerations. For information about frozen and nonfrozen
enumerations, see [frozen](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/attributes#frozen).

When switching over a nonfrozen enumeration value, you always need to include
a default case, even if every case of the enumeration already has a
corresponding switch case. You can apply the `@unknown` attribute to the
default case, which indicates that the default case should match only
enumeration cases that are added in the future. Swift produces a warning if
the default case matches any enumeration case that’s known at compiler time.
This future warning informs you that the library author added a new case to
the enumeration that doesn’t have a corresponding switch case.

The following example switches over all three existing cases of the Swift
standard library’s
[`Mirror.AncestorRepresentation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/mirror/ancestorrepresentation)
enumeration. If you add additional cases in the future, the compiler generates
a warning to indicate that you need to update the switch statement to take the
new cases into account.

    
    
    let representation: Mirror.AncestorRepresentation = .generated
    switch representation {
    case .customized:
        print("Use the nearest ancestor’s implementation.")
    case .generated:
        print("Generate a default mirror for all ancestor classes.")
    case .suppressed:
        print("Suppress the representation of all ancestor classes.")
    @unknown default:
        print("Use a representation that was unknown when this code was compiled.")
    }
    // Prints "Generate a default mirror for all ancestor classes."
    

#### [Execution Does Not Fall Through Cases Implicitly](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/statements/#Execution-Does-
Not-Fall-Through-Cases-Implicitly)

After the code within a matched case has finished executing, the program exits
from the `switch` statement. Program execution doesn’t continue or “fall
through” to the next case or default case. That said, if you want execution to
continue from one case to the next, explicitly include a `fallthrough`
statement, which simply consists of the `fallthrough` keyword, in the case
from which you want execution to continue. For more information about the
`fallthrough` statement, see [Fallthrough Statement](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/statements#Fallthrough-
Statement) below.

## [Labeled Statement](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements/#Labeled-Statement)

You can prefix a loop statement, an `if` statement, a `switch` statement, or a
`do` statement with a _statement label_ , which consists of the name of the
label followed immediately by a colon (:). Use statement labels with `break`
and `continue` statements to be explicit about how you want to change control
flow in a loop statement or a `switch` statement, as discussed in [Break
Statement](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements#Break-Statement) and [Continue Statement](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/statements#Continue-
Statement) below.

The scope of a labeled statement is the entire statement following the
statement label. You can nest labeled statements, but the name of each
statement label must be unique.

For more information and to see examples of how to use statement labels, see
[Labeled Statements](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/controlflow#Labeled-Statements) in [Control Flow](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/controlflow).

Grammar of a labeled statement

 _labeled-statement_ → _statement-label_ _loop-statement_  
_labeled-statement_ → _statement-label_ _if-statement_  
_labeled-statement_ → _statement-label_ _switch-statement_  
_labeled-statement_ → _statement-label_ _do-statement_

 _statement-label_ → _label-name_ **`:`**  
_label-name_ → _identifier_

## [Control Transfer Statements](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/statements/#Control-Transfer-Statements)

Control transfer statements can change the order in which code in your program
is executed by unconditionally transferring program control from one piece of
code to another. Swift has five control transfer statements: a `break`
statement, a `continue` statement, a `fallthrough` statement, a `return`
statement, and a `throw` statement.

Grammar of a control transfer statement

 _control-transfer-statement_ → _break-statement_  
_control-transfer-statement_ → _continue-statement_  
_control-transfer-statement_ → _fallthrough-statement_  
_control-transfer-statement_ → _return-statement_  
_control-transfer-statement_ → _throw-statement_

### [Break Statement](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements/#Break-Statement)

A `break` statement ends program execution of a loop, an `if` statement, or a
`switch` statement. A `break` statement can consist of only the `break`
keyword, or it can consist of the `break` keyword followed by the name of a
statement label, as shown below.

    
    
    break
    break <#label name#>
    

When a `break` statement is followed by the name of a statement label, it ends
program execution of the loop, `if` statement, or `switch` statement named by
that label.

When a `break` statement isn’t followed by the name of a statement label, it
ends program execution of the `switch` statement or the innermost enclosing
loop statement in which it occurs. You can’t use an unlabeled `break`
statement to break out of an `if` statement.

In both cases, program control is then transferred to the first line of code
following the enclosing loop or `switch` statement, if any.

For examples of how to use a `break` statement, see [Break](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/controlflow#Break) and
[Labeled Statements](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/controlflow#Labeled-Statements) in [Control Flow](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/controlflow).

Grammar of a break statement

 _break-statement_ → **`break`** _label-name_ _?_

### [Continue Statement](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements/#Continue-Statement)

A `continue` statement ends program execution of the current iteration of a
loop statement but doesn’t stop execution of the loop statement. A `continue`
statement can consist of only the `continue` keyword, or it can consist of the
`continue` keyword followed by the name of a statement label, as shown below.

    
    
    continue
    continue <#label name#>
    

When a `continue` statement is followed by the name of a statement label, it
ends program execution of the current iteration of the loop statement named by
that label.

When a `continue` statement isn’t followed by the name of a statement label,
it ends program execution of the current iteration of the innermost enclosing
loop statement in which it occurs.

In both cases, program control is then transferred to the condition of the
enclosing loop statement.

In a `for` statement, the increment expression is still evaluated after the
`continue` statement is executed, because the increment expression is
evaluated after the execution of the loop’s body.

For examples of how to use a `continue` statement, see [Continue](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/controlflow#Continue) and
[Labeled Statements](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/controlflow#Labeled-Statements) in [Control Flow](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/controlflow).

Grammar of a continue statement

 _continue-statement_ → **`continue`** _label-name_ _?_

### [Fallthrough Statement](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements/#Fallthrough-Statement)

A `fallthrough` statement consists of the `fallthrough` keyword and occurs
only in a case block of a `switch` statement. A `fallthrough` statement causes
program execution to continue from one case in a `switch` statement to the
next case. Program execution continues to the next case even if the patterns
of the case label don’t match the value of the `switch` statement’s control
expression.

A `fallthrough` statement can appear anywhere inside a `switch` statement, not
just as the last statement of a case block, but it can’t be used in the final
case block. It also can’t transfer control into a case block whose pattern
contains value binding patterns.

For an example of how to use a `fallthrough` statement in a `switch`
statement, see [Control Transfer Statements](/swift-book/documentation/the-
swift-programming-language/controlflow#Control-Transfer-Statements) in
[Control Flow](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/controlflow).

Grammar of a fallthrough statement

 _fallthrough-statement_ → **`fallthrough`**

### [Return Statement](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements/#Return-Statement)

A `return` statement occurs in the body of a function or method definition and
causes program execution to return to the calling function or method. Program
execution continues at the point immediately following the function or method
call.

A `return` statement can consist of only the `return` keyword, or it can
consist of the `return` keyword followed by an expression, as shown below.

    
    
    return
    return <#expression#>
    

When a `return` statement is followed by an expression, the value of the
expression is returned to the calling function or method. If the value of the
expression doesn’t match the value of the return type declared in the function
or method declaration, the expression’s value is converted to the return type
before it’s returned to the calling function or method.

Note

As described in [Failable Initializers](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/declarations#Failable-Initializers), a special form of
the `return` statement (`return nil`) can be used in a failable initializer to
indicate initialization failure.

When a `return` statement isn’t followed by an expression, it can be used only
to return from a function or method that doesn’t return a value (that is, when
the return type of the function or method is `Void` or `()`).

Grammar of a return statement

 _return-statement_ → **`return`** _expression_ _?_

### [Throw Statement](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements/#Throw-Statement)

A `throw` statement occurs in the body of a throwing function or method, or in
the body of a closure expression whose type is marked with the `throws`
keyword.

A `throw` statement causes a program to end execution of the current scope and
begin error propagation to its enclosing scope. The error that’s thrown
continues to propagate until it’s handled by a `catch` clause of a `do`
statement.

A `throw` statement consists of the `throw` keyword followed by an expression,
as shown below.

    
    
    throw <#expression#>
    

The value of the _expression_ must have a type that conforms to the `Error`
protocol. If the `do` statement or function that contains the `throw`
statement declares the type of errors it throws, the value of the _expression_
must be an instance of that type.

For an example of how to use a `throw` statement, see [Propagating Errors
Using Throwing Functions](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/errorhandling#Propagating-Errors-Using-Throwing-Functions) in [Error
Handling](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/errorhandling).

Grammar of a throw statement

 _throw-statement_ → **`throw`** _expression_

## [Defer Statement](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements/#Defer-Statement)

A `defer` statement is used for executing code just before transferring
program control outside of the scope that the `defer` statement appears in.

A `defer` statement has the following form:

    
    
    defer {
        <#statements#>
    }
    

The statements within the `defer` statement are executed no matter how program
control is transferred. This means that a `defer` statement can be used, for
example, to perform manual resource management such as closing file
descriptors, and to perform actions that need to happen even if an error is
thrown.

The _statements_ in the `defer` statement are executed at the end of the scope
that encloses the `defer` statement.

    
    
    func f(x: Int) {
      defer { print("First defer") }
    
    
      if x < 10 {
        defer { print("Second defer") }
        print("End of if")
      }
    
    
      print("End of function")
    }
    f(x: 5)
    // Prints "End of if"
    // Prints "Second defer"
    // Prints "End of function"
    // Prints "First defer"
    

In the code above, the `defer` in the `if` statement executes before the
`defer` declared in the function `f` because the scope of the `if` statement
ends before the scope of the function.

If multiple `defer` statements appear in the same scope, the order they appear
is the reverse of the order they’re executed. Executing the last `defer`
statement in a given scope first means that statements inside that last
`defer` statement can refer to resources that will be cleaned up by other
`defer` statements.

    
    
    func f() {
        defer { print("First defer") }
        defer { print("Second defer") }
        print("End of function")
    }
    f()
    // Prints "End of function"
    // Prints "Second defer"
    // Prints "First defer"
    

The statements in the `defer` statement can’t transfer program control outside
of the `defer` statement.

## [Do Statement](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements/#Do-Statement)

The `do` statement is used to introduce a new scope and can optionally contain
one or more `catch` clauses, which contain patterns that match against defined
error conditions. Variables and constants declared in the scope of a `do`
statement can be accessed only within that scope.

A `do` statement in Swift is similar to curly braces (`{}`) in C used to
delimit a code block, and doesn’t incur a performance cost at runtime.

A `do` statement has the following form:

    
    
    do {
        try <#expression#>
        <#statements#>
    } catch <#pattern 1#> {
        <#statements#>
    } catch <#pattern 2#> where <#condition#> {
        <#statements#>
    } catch <#pattern 3#>, <#pattern 4#> where <#condition#> {
        <#statements#>
    } catch {
        <#statements#>
    }
    

A `do` statement can optionally specify the type of error it throws, which has
the following form:

    
    
    do throws(<#type#>) {
        try <#expression#>
    } catch <#pattern> {
        <#statements#>
    } catch {
        <#statements#>
    }
    

If the `do` statement includes a `throws` clause, the `do` block can throw
errors of only the specified _type_. The _type_ must be a concrete type that
conforms to the `Error` protocol, an opaque type that conforms to the `Error`
protocol, or the boxed protocol type `any Error`. If the `do` statement
doesn’t specify the type of error it throws, Swift infers the error type as
follows:

  * If every `throws` statement and `try` expression in the `do` code block is nested inside of an exhaustive error-handling mechanism, then Swift infers that the `do` statement is nonthrowing.

  * If the `do` code block contains code that throws errors of only a single type outside of exhaustive error handling, other than throwing `Never`, then Swift infers that the `do` statement throws that concrete error type.

  * If the `do` code block contains code that throws errors of more than a single type outside of exhaustive error handling, then Swift infers that the `do` statement throws `any Error`.

For more information about working with errors that have explicit types, see
[Specifying the Error Type](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/errorhandling#Specifying-the-Error-Type).

If any statement in the `do` code block throws an error, program control is
transferred to the first `catch` clause whose pattern matches the error. If
none of the clauses match, the error propagates to the surrounding scope. If
an error is unhandled at the top level, program execution stops with a runtime
error.

Like a `switch` statement, the compiler attempts to infer whether `catch`
clauses are exhaustive. If such a determination can be made, the error is
considered handled. Otherwise, the error can propagate out of the containing
scope, which means the error must be handled by an enclosing `catch` clause or
the containing function must be declared with `throws`.

A `catch` clause that has multiple patterns matches the error if any of its
patterns match the error. If a `catch` clause contains multiple patterns, all
of the patterns must contain the same constant or variable bindings, and each
bound variable or constant must have the same type in all of the `catch`
clause’s patterns.

To ensure that an error is handled, use a `catch` clause with a pattern that
matches all errors, such as a wildcard pattern (`_`). If a `catch` clause
doesn’t specify a pattern, the `catch` clause matches and binds any error to a
local constant named `error`. For more information about the patterns you can
use in a `catch` clause, see [Patterns](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/patterns).

To see an example of how to use a `do` statement with several `catch` clauses,
see [Handling Errors](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/errorhandling#Handling-Errors).

## [Compiler Control Statements](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/statements/#Compiler-Control-Statements)

Compiler control statements allow the program to change aspects of the
compiler’s behavior. Swift has three compiler control statements: a
conditional compilation block a line control statement, and a compile-time
diagnostic statement.

### [Conditional Compilation Block](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/statements/#Conditional-Compilation-Block)

A conditional compilation block allows code to be conditionally compiled
depending on the value of one or more compilation conditions.

Every conditional compilation block begins with the `#if` compilation
directive and ends with the `#endif` compilation directive. A simple
conditional compilation block has the following form:

    
    
    #if <#compilation condition#>
        <#statements#>
    #endif
    

Unlike the condition of an `if` statement, the _compilation condition_ is
evaluated at compile time. As a result, the _statements_ are compiled and
executed only if the _compilation condition_ evaluates to `true` at compile
time.

The _compilation condition_ can include the `true` and `false` Boolean
literals, an identifier used with the `-D` command line flag, or any of the
platform conditions listed in the table below.

Platform condition| Valid arguments  
---|---  
`os()`| `macOS`, `iOS`, `watchOS`, `tvOS`, `visionOS`, `Linux`, `Windows`  
`arch()`| `arm`, `arm64`, `i386`, `wasm32`, `x86_64`,  
`swift()`| `>=` or `<` followed by a version number  
`compiler()`| `>=` or `<` followed by a version number  
`canImport()`| A module name  
`targetEnvironment()`| `simulator`, `macCatalyst`  
  
The version number for the `swift()` and `compiler()` platform conditions
consists of a major number, optional minor number, optional patch number, and
so on, with a dot (`.`) separating each part of the version number. There must
not be whitespace between the comparison operator and the version number. The
version for `compiler()` is the compiler version, regardless of the Swift
version setting passed to the compiler. The version for `swift()` is the
language version currently being compiled. For example, if you compile your
code using the Swift 5 compiler in Swift 4.2 mode, the compiler version is 5
and the language version is 4.2. With those settings, the following code
prints all three messages:

    
    
    #if compiler(>=5)
    print("Compiled with the Swift 5 compiler or later")
    #endif
    #if swift(>=4.2)
    print("Compiled in Swift 4.2 mode or later")
    #endif
    #if compiler(>=5) && swift(<5)
    print("Compiled with the Swift 5 compiler or later in a Swift mode earlier than 5")
    #endif
    // Prints "Compiled with the Swift 5 compiler or later"
    // Prints "Compiled in Swift 4.2 mode or later"
    // Prints "Compiled with the Swift 5 compiler or later in a Swift mode earlier than 5"
    

The argument for the `canImport()` platform condition is the name of a module
that may not be present on all platforms. The module can include periods (`.`)
in its name. This condition tests whether it’s possible to import the module,
but doesn’t actually import it. If the module is present, the platform
condition returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

The `targetEnvironment()` platform condition returns `true` when code is being
compiled for the specified environment; otherwise, it returns `false`.

Note

The `arch(arm)` platform condition doesn’t return `true` for ARM 64 devices.
The `arch(i386)` platform condition returns `true` when code is compiled for
the 32–bit iOS simulator.

You can combine and negate compilation conditions using the logical operators
`&&`, `||`, and `!` and use parentheses for grouping. These operators have the
same associativity and precedence as the logical operators that are used to
combine ordinary Boolean expressions.

Similar to an `if` statement, you can add multiple conditional branches to
test for different compilation conditions. You can add any number of
additional branches using `#elseif` clauses. You can also add a final
additional branch using an `#else` clause. Conditional compilation blocks that
contain multiple branches have the following form:

    
    
    #if <#compilation condition 1#>
        <#statements to compile if compilation condition 1 is true#>
    #elseif <#compilation condition 2#>
        <#statements to compile if compilation condition 2 is true#>
    #else
        <#statements to compile if both compilation conditions are false#>
    #endif
    

Note

Each statement in the body of a conditional compilation block is parsed even
if it’s not compiled. However, there’s an exception if the compilation
condition includes a `swift()` or `compiler()` platform condition: The
statements are parsed only if the language or compiler version matches what is
specified in the platform condition. This exception ensures that an older
compiler doesn’t attempt to parse syntax introduced in a newer version of
Swift.

For information about how you can wrap explicit member expressions in
conditional compilation blocks, see [Explicit Member Expression](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/expressions#Explicit-Member-
Expression).

### [Line Control Statement](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements/#Line-Control-Statement)

A line control statement is used to specify a line number and filename that
can be different from the line number and filename of the source code being
compiled. Use a line control statement to change the source code location used
by Swift for diagnostic and debugging purposes.

A line control statement has the following forms:

    
    
    #sourceLocation(file: <#file path#>, line: <#line number#>)
    #sourceLocation()
    

The first form of a line control statement changes the values of the `#line`,
`#file`, `#fileID`, and `#filePath` literal expressions, beginning with the
line of code following the line control statement. The _line number_ changes
the value of `#line`, and is any integer literal greater than zero. The _file
path_ changes the value of `#file`, `#fileID`, and `#filePath`, and is a
string literal. The specified string becomes the value of `#filePath`, and the
last path component of the string is used by the value of `#fileID`. For
information about `#file`, `#fileID`, and `#filePath`, see [Literal
Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions#Literal-Expression).

The second form of a line control statement, `#sourceLocation()`, resets the
source code location back to the default line numbering and file path.

Grammar of a line control statement

 _line-control-statement_ → **`#source Location`** **`(`** **`file:`** _file-
path_ **`,`** **`line:`** _line-number_ **`)`**  
_line-control-statement_ → **`#source Location`** **`(`** **`)`**  
_line-number_ → A decimal integer greater than zero  
_file-path_ → _static-string-literal_

### [Compile-Time Diagnostic Statement](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/statements/#Compile-Time-Diagnostic-Statement)

Prior to Swift 5.9, the `#warning` and `#error` statements emit a diagnostic
during compilation. This behavior is now provided by the
[`warning(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/warning\(_:\))
and [`error(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/error\(_:\))
macros in the Swift standard library.

## [Availability Condition](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/statements/#Availability-Condition)

An _availability condition_ is used as a condition of an `if`, `while`, and
`guard` statement to query the availability of APIs at runtime, based on
specified platforms arguments.

An availability condition has the following form:

    
    
    if #available(<#platform name#> <#version#>, <#...#>, *) {
        <#statements to execute if the APIs are available#>
    } else {
        <#fallback statements to execute if the APIs are unavailable#>
    }
    

You use an availability condition to execute a block of code, depending on
whether the APIs you want to use are available at runtime. The compiler uses
the information from the availability condition when it verifies that the APIs
in that block of code are available.

The availability condition takes a comma-separated list of platform names and
versions. Use `iOS`, `macOS`, `watchOS`, `tvOS` and `visionOS` for the
platform names, and include the corresponding version numbers. The `*`
argument is required and specifies that, on any other platform, the body of
the code block guarded by the availability condition executes on the minimum
deployment target specified by your target.

Unlike Boolean conditions, you can’t combine availability conditions using
logical operators like `&&` and `||`. Instead of using `!` to negate an
availability condition, use an unavailability condition, which has the
following form:

    
    
    if #unavailable(<#platform name#> <#version#>, <#...#>) {
        <#fallback statements to execute if the APIs are unavailable#>
    } else {
        <#statements to execute if the APIs are available#>
    }
    

The `#unavailable` form is syntactic sugar that negates the condition. In an
unavailability condition, the `*` argument is implicit and must not be
included. It has the same meaning as the `*` argument in an availability
condition.
