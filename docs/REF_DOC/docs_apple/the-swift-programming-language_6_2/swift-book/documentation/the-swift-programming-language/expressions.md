# Expressions

Access, modify, and assign values.

In Swift, there are four kinds of expressions: prefix expressions, infix
expressions, primary expressions, and postfix expressions. Evaluating an
expression returns a value, causes a side effect, or both.

Prefix and infix expressions let you apply operators to smaller expressions.
Primary expressions are conceptually the simplest kind of expression, and they
provide a way to access values. Postfix expressions, like prefix and infix
expressions, let you build up more complex expressions using postfixes such as
function calls and member access. Each kind of expression is described in
detail in the sections below.

Grammar of an expression

 _expression_ → _try-operator_ _?_ _await-operator_ _?_ _prefix-expression_
_infix-expressions_ _?_

## [Prefix Expressions](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Prefix-Expressions)

 _Prefix expressions_ combine an optional prefix operator with an expression.
Prefix operators take one argument, the expression that follows them.

For information about the behavior of these operators, see [Basic
Operators](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/basicoperators) and [Advanced Operators](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/advancedoperators).

For information about the operators provided by the Swift standard library,
see [Operator
Declarations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/operator_declarations).

Grammar of a prefix expression

 _prefix-expression_ → _prefix-operator_ _?_ _postfix-expression_  
_prefix-expression_ → _in-out-expression_

### [In-Out Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#In-Out-Expression)

An _in-out expression_ marks a variable that’s being passed as an in-out
argument to a function call expression.

    
    
    &<#expression#>
    

For more information about in-out parameters and to see an example, see [In-
Out Parameters](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/functions#In-Out-Parameters).

In-out expressions are also used when providing a non-pointer argument in a
context where a pointer is needed, as described in [Implicit Conversion to a
Pointer Type](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions#Implicit-Conversion-to-a-Pointer-Type).

Grammar of an in-out expression

 _in-out-expression_ → **`&`** _primary-expression_

### [Try Operator](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Try-Operator)

A _try expression_ consists of the `try` operator followed by an expression
that can throw an error. It has the following form:

    
    
    try <#expression#>
    

The value of a `try` expression is the value of the _expression_.

An _optional-try expression_ consists of the `try?` operator followed by an
expression that can throw an error. It has the following form:

    
    
    try? <#expression#>
    

If the _expression_ doesn’t throw an error, the value of the optional-try
expression is an optional containing the value of the _expression_. Otherwise,
the value of the optional-try expression is `nil`.

A _forced-try expression_ consists of the `try!` operator followed by an
expression that can throw an error. It has the following form:

    
    
    try! <#expression#>
    

The value of a forced-try expression is the value of the _expression_. If the
_expression_ throws an error, a runtime error is produced.

When the expression on the left-hand side of an infix operator is marked with
`try`, `try?`, or `try!`, that operator applies to the whole infix expression.
That said, you can use parentheses to be explicit about the scope of the
operator’s application.

    
    
    // try applies to both function calls
    sum = try someThrowingFunction() + anotherThrowingFunction()
    
    
    // try applies to both function calls
    sum = try (someThrowingFunction() + anotherThrowingFunction())
    
    
    // Error: try applies only to the first function call
    sum = (try someThrowingFunction()) + anotherThrowingFunction()
    

A `try` expression can’t appear on the right-hand side of an infix operator,
unless the infix operator is the assignment operator or the `try` expression
is enclosed in parentheses.

If an expression includes both the `try` and `await` operator, the `try`
operator must appear first.

For more information and to see examples of how to use `try`, `try?`, and
`try!`, see [Error Handling](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/errorhandling).

Grammar of a try expression

 _try-operator_ → **`try`** | **`try`** **`?`** | **`try`** **`!`**

### [Await Operator](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Await-Operator)

An _await expression_ consists of the `await` operator followed by an
expression that uses the result of an asynchronous operation. It has the
following form:

    
    
    await <#expression#>
    

The value of an `await` expression is the value of the _expression_.

An expression marked with `await` is called a _potential suspension point_.
Execution of an asynchronous function can be suspended at each expression
that’s marked with `await`. In addition, execution of concurrent code is never
suspended at any other point. This means code between potential suspension
points can safely update state that requires temporarily breaking invariants,
provided that it completes the update before the next potential suspension
point.

An `await` expression can appear only within an asynchronous context, such as
the trailing closure passed to the `async(priority:operation:)` function. It
can’t appear in the body of a `defer` statement, or in an autoclosure of
synchronous function type.

When the expression on the left-hand side of an infix operator is marked with
the `await` operator, that operator applies to the whole infix expression.
That said, you can use parentheses to be explicit about the scope of the
operator’s application.

    
    
    // await applies to both function calls
    sum = await someAsyncFunction() + anotherAsyncFunction()
    
    
    // await applies to both function calls
    sum = await (someAsyncFunction() + anotherAsyncFunction())
    
    
    // Error: await applies only to the first function call
    sum = (await someAsyncFunction()) + anotherAsyncFunction()
    

An `await` expression can’t appear on the right-hand side of an infix
operator, unless the infix operator is the assignment operator or the `await`
expression is enclosed in parentheses.

If an expression includes both the `await` and `try` operator, the `try`
operator must appear first.

Grammar of an await expression

 _await-operator_ → **`await`**

## [Infix Expressions](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Infix-Expressions)

 _Infix expressions_ combine an infix binary operator with the expression that
it takes as its left- and right-hand arguments. It has the following form:

    
    
    <#left-hand argument#> <#operator#> <#right-hand argument#>
    

For information about the behavior of these operators, see [Basic
Operators](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/basicoperators) and [Advanced Operators](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/advancedoperators).

For information about the operators provided by the Swift standard library,
see [Operator
Declarations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/operator_declarations).

Note

At parse time, an expression made up of infix operators is represented as a
flat list. This list is transformed into a tree by applying operator
precedence. For example, the expression `2 + 3 * 5` is initially understood as
a flat list of five items, `2`, `+`, `3`, `*`, and `5`. This process
transforms it into the tree (2 + (3 * 5)).

Grammar of an infix expression

 _infix-expression_ → _infix-operator_ _prefix-expression_  
_infix-expression_ → _assignment-operator_ _try-operator_ _?_ _await-operator_
_?_ _prefix-expression_  
_infix-expression_ → _conditional-operator_ _try-operator_ _?_ _await-
operator_ _?_ _prefix-expression_  
_infix-expression_ → _type-casting-operator_  
_infix-expressions_ → _infix-expression_ _infix-expressions_ _?_

### [Assignment Operator](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Assignment-Operator)

The _assignment operator_ sets a new value for a given expression. It has the
following form:

    
    
    <#expression#> = <#value#>
    

The value of the _expression_ is set to the value obtained by evaluating the
_value_. If the _expression_ is a tuple, the _value_ must be a tuple with the
same number of elements. (Nested tuples are allowed.) Assignment is performed
from each part of the _value_ to the corresponding part of the _expression_.
For example:

    
    
    (a, _, (b, c)) = ("test", 9.45, (12, 3))
    // a is "test", b is 12, c is 3, and 9.45 is ignored
    

The assignment operator doesn’t return any value.

Grammar of an assignment operator

 _assignment-operator_ → **`=`**

### [Ternary Conditional Operator](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/expressions/#Ternary-Conditional-Operator)

The _ternary conditional operator_ evaluates to one of two given values based
on the value of a condition. It has the following form:

    
    
    <#condition#> ? <#expression used if true#> : <#expression used if false#>
    

If the _condition_ evaluates to `true`, the conditional operator evaluates the
first expression and returns its value. Otherwise, it evaluates the second
expression and returns its value. The unused expression isn’t evaluated.

For an example that uses the ternary conditional operator, see [Ternary
Conditional Operator](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/basicoperators#Ternary-Conditional-Operator).

Grammar of a conditional operator

 _conditional-operator_ → **`?`** _expression_ **`:`**

### [Type-Casting Operators](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Type-Casting-Operators)

There are four type-casting operators: the `is` operator, the `as` operator,
the `as?` operator, and the `as!` operator.

They have the following form:

    
    
    <#expression#> is <#type#>
    <#expression#> as <#type#>
    <#expression#> as? <#type#>
    <#expression#> as! <#type#>
    

The `is` operator checks at runtime whether the _expression_ can be cast to
the specified _type_. It returns `true` if the _expression_ can be cast to the
specified _type_ ; otherwise, it returns `false`.

The `as` operator performs a cast when it’s known at compile time that the
cast always succeeds, such as upcasting or bridging. Upcasting lets you use an
expression as an instance of its type’s supertype, without using an
intermediate variable. The following approaches are equivalent:

    
    
    func f(_ any: Any) { print("Function for Any") }
    func f(_ int: Int) { print("Function for Int") }
    let x = 10
    f(x)
    // Prints "Function for Int"
    
    
    let y: Any = x
    f(y)
    // Prints "Function for Any"
    
    
    f(x as Any)
    // Prints "Function for Any"
    

Bridging lets you use an expression of a Swift standard library type such as
`String` as its corresponding Foundation type such as `NSString` without
needing to create a new instance. For more information on bridging, see
[Working with Foundation
Types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/imported_c_and_objective_c_apis/working_with_foundation_types).

The `as?` operator performs a conditional cast of the _expression_ to the
specified _type_. The `as?` operator returns an optional of the specified
_type_. At runtime, if the cast succeeds, the value of _expression_ is wrapped
in an optional and returned; otherwise, the value returned is `nil`. If
casting to the specified _type_ is guaranteed to fail or is guaranteed to
succeed, a compile-time error is raised.

The `as!` operator performs a forced cast of the _expression_ to the specified
_type_. The `as!` operator returns a value of the specified _type_ , not an
optional type. If the cast fails, a runtime error is raised. The behavior of
`x as! T` is the same as the behavior of `(x as? T)!`.

For more information about type casting and to see examples that use the type-
casting operators, see [Type Casting](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/typecasting).

Grammar of a type-casting operator

 _type-casting-operator_ → **`is`** _type_  
_type-casting-operator_ → **`as`** _type_  
_type-casting-operator_ → **`as`** **`?`** _type_  
_type-casting-operator_ → **`as`** **`!`** _type_

## [Primary Expressions](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Primary-Expressions)

 _Primary expressions_ are the most basic kind of expression. They can be used
as expressions on their own, and they can be combined with other tokens to
make prefix expressions, infix expressions, and postfix expressions.

Grammar of a primary expression

 _primary-expression_ → _identifier_ _generic-argument-clause_ _?_  
_primary-expression_ → _literal-expression_  
_primary-expression_ → _self-expression_  
_primary-expression_ → _superclass-expression_  
_primary-expression_ → _conditional-expression_  
_primary-expression_ → _closure-expression_  
_primary-expression_ → _parenthesized-expression_  
_primary-expression_ → _tuple-expression_  
_primary-expression_ → _implicit-member-expression_  
_primary-expression_ → _wildcard-expression_  
_primary-expression_ → _macro-expansion-expression_  
_primary-expression_ → _key-path-expression_  
_primary-expression_ → _selector-expression_  
_primary-expression_ → _key-path-string-expression_

### [Literal Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Literal-Expression)

A _literal expression_ consists of either an ordinary literal (such as a
string or a number), an array or dictionary literal, or a playground literal.

Note

Prior to Swift 5.9, the following special literals were recognized: `#column`,
`#dsohandle`, `#fileID`, `#filePath`, `#file`, `#function`, and `#line`. These
are now implemented as macros in the Swift standard library:
[`column()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/column\(\)),
[`dsohandle()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/dsohandle\(\)),
[`fileID()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/fileID\(\)),
[`filePath()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/filePath\(\)),
[`file()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/file\(\)),
[`function()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/function\(\)),
and [`line()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/line\(\)).

An _array literal_ is an ordered collection of values. It has the following
form:

    
    
    [<#value 1#>, <#value 2#>, <#...#>]
    

The last expression in the array can be followed by an optional comma. The
value of an array literal has type `[T]`, where `T` is the type of the
expressions inside it. If there are expressions of multiple types, `T` is
their closest common supertype. Empty array literals are written using an
empty pair of square brackets and can be used to create an empty array of a
specified type.

    
    
    var emptyArray: [Double] = []
    

A _dictionary literal_ is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. It has
the following form:

    
    
    [<#key 1#>: <#value 1#>, <#key 2#>: <#value 2#>, <#...#>]
    

The last expression in the dictionary can be followed by an optional comma.
The value of a dictionary literal has type `[Key: Value]`, where `Key` is the
type of its key expressions and `Value` is the type of its value expressions.
If there are expressions of multiple types, `Key` and `Value` are the closest
common supertype for their respective values. An empty dictionary literal is
written as a colon inside a pair of brackets (`[:]`) to distinguish it from an
empty array literal. You can use an empty dictionary literal to create an
empty dictionary literal of specified key and value types.

    
    
    var emptyDictionary: [String: Double] = [:]
    

A _playground literal_ is used by Xcode to create an interactive
representation of a color, file, or image within the program editor.
Playground literals in plain text outside of Xcode are represented using a
special literal syntax.

For information on using playground literals in Xcode, see [Add a color, file,
or image literal](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev4c60242fc) in
Xcode Help.

_expression_ **`)`**  
_playground-literal_ → **`#image Literal`** **`(`** **`resource Name`**
**`:`** _expression_ **`)`**

### [Self Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Self-Expression)

The `self` expression is an explicit reference to the current type or instance
of the type in which it occurs. It has the following forms:

    
    
    self
    self.<#member name#>
    self[<#subscript index#>]
    self(<#initializer arguments#>)
    self.init(<#initializer arguments#>)
    

In an initializer, subscript, or instance method, `self` refers to the current
instance of the type in which it occurs. In a type method, `self` refers to
the current type in which it occurs.

The `self` expression is used to specify scope when accessing members,
providing disambiguation when there’s another variable of the same name in
scope, such as a function parameter. For example:

    
    
    class SomeClass {
        var greeting: String
        init(greeting: String) {
            self.greeting = greeting
        }
    }
    

In a mutating method of a value type, you can assign a new instance of that
value type to `self`. For example:

    
    
    struct Point {
        var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
        mutating func moveBy(x deltaX: Double, y deltaY: Double) {
            self = Point(x: x + deltaX, y: y + deltaY)
        }
    }
    

Grammar of a self expression

 _self-expression_ → **`self`** | _self-method-expression_ | _self-subscript-expression_ | _self-initializer-expression_

 _self-method-expression_ → **`self`** **`.`** _identifier_  
_self-subscript-expression_ → **`self`** **`[`** _function-call-argument-list_
**`]`**  
_self-initializer-expression_ → **`self`** **`.`** **`init`**

### [Superclass Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Superclass-Expression)

A _superclass expression_ lets a class interact with its superclass. It has
one of the following forms:

    
    
    super.<#member name#>
    super[<#subscript index#>]
    super.init(<#initializer arguments#>)
    

The first form is used to access a member of the superclass. The second form
is used to access the superclass’s subscript implementation. The third form is
used to access an initializer of the superclass.

Subclasses can use a superclass expression in their implementation of members,
subscripting, and initializers to make use of the implementation in their
superclass.

Grammar of a superclass expression

 _superclass-expression_ → _superclass-method-expression_ | _superclass-subscript-expression_ | _superclass-initializer-expression_

 _superclass-method-expression_ → **`super`** **`.`** _identifier_  
_superclass-subscript-expression_ → **`super`** **`[`** _function-call-
argument-list_ **`]`**  
_superclass-initializer-expression_ → **`super`** **`.`** **`init`**

### [Conditional Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Conditional-Expression)

A _conditional expression_ evaluates to one of several given values based on
the value of a condition. It has one the following forms:

    
    
    if <#condition 1#> {
       <#expression used if condition 1 is true#>
    } else if <#condition 2#> {
       <#expression used if condition 2 is true#>
    } else {
       <#expression used if both conditions are false#>
    }
    
    
    switch <#expression#> {
    case <#pattern 1#>:
        <#expression 1#>
    case <#pattern 2#> where <#condition#>:
        <#expression 2#>
    default:
        <#expression 3#>
    }
    

A conditional expression has the same behavior and syntax as an `if` statement
or a `switch` statement, except for the differences that the paragraphs below
describe.

A conditional expression appears only in the following contexts:

  * As the value assigned to a variable.

  * As the initial value in a variable or constant declaration.

  * As the error thrown by a `throw` expression.

  * As the value returned by a function, closure, or property getter.

  * As the value inside a branch of a conditional expression.

The branches of a conditional expression are exhaustive, ensuring that the
expression always produces a value regardless of the condition. This means
each `if` branch needs a corresponding `else` branch.

Each branch contains either a single expression, which is used as the value
for the conditional expression when that branch’s conditional is true, a
`throw` statement, or a call to a function that never returns.

Each branch must produce a value of the same type. Because type checking of
each branch is independent, you sometimes need to specify the value’s type
explicitly, like when branches include different kinds of literals, or when a
branch’s value is `nil`. When you need to provide this information, add a type
annotation to the variable that the result is assigned to, or add an `as` cast
to the branches’ values.

    
    
    let number: Double = if someCondition { 10 } else { 12.34 }
    let number = if someCondition { 10 as Double } else { 12.34 }
    

Inside a result builder, conditional expressions can appear only as the
initial value of a variable or constant. This behavior means when you write
`if` or `switch` in a result builder — outside of a variable or constant
declaration — that code is understood as a branch statement and one of the
result builder’s methods transforms that code.

Don’t put a conditional expression in a `try` expression, even if one of the
branches of a conditional expression is throwing.

_switch-expression-case_ → _case-label_ _statement_  
_switch-expression-case_ → _default-label_ _statement_

### [Closure Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Closure-Expression)

A _closure expression_ creates a closure, also known as a _lambda_ or an
_anonymous function_ in other programming languages. Like a function
declaration, a closure contains statements, and it captures constants and
variables from its enclosing scope. It has the following form:

    
    
    { (<#parameters#>) -> <#return type#> in
       <#statements#>
    }
    

The _parameters_ have the same form as the parameters in a function
declaration, as described in [Function Declaration](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/declarations#Function-
Declaration).

Writing `throws` or `async` in a closure expression explicitly marks a closure
as throwing or asynchronous.

    
    
    { (<#parameters#>) async throws -> <#return type#> in
       <#statements#>
    }
    

If the body of a closure includes a `throws` statement or a `try` expression
that isn’t nested inside of a `do` statement with exhaustive error handling,
the closure is understood to be throwing. If a throwing closure throws errors
of only a single type, the closure is understood as throwing that error type;
otherwise, it’s understood as throwing `any Error`. Likewise, if the body
includes an `await` expression, it’s understood to be asynchronous.

There are several special forms that allow closures to be written more
concisely:

  * A closure can omit the types of its parameters, its return type, or both. If you omit the parameter names and both types, omit the `in` keyword before the statements. If the omitted types can’t be inferred, a compile-time error is raised.

  * A closure may omit names for its parameters. Its parameters are then implicitly named `$` followed by their position: `$0`, `$1`, `$2`, and so on.

  * A closure that consists of only a single expression is understood to return the value of that expression. The contents of this expression are also considered when performing type inference on the surrounding expression.

The following closure expressions are equivalent:

    
    
    myFunction { (x: Int, y: Int) -> Int in
        return x + y
    }
    
    
    myFunction { x, y in
        return x + y
    }
    
    
    myFunction { return $0 + $1 }
    
    
    myFunction { $0 + $1 }
    

For information about passing a closure as an argument to a function, see
[Function Call Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions#Function-Call-Expression).

Closure expressions can be used without being stored in a variable or
constant, such as when you immediately use a closure as part of a function
call. The closure expressions passed to `myFunction` in code above are
examples of this kind of immediate use. As a result, whether a closure
expression is escaping or nonescaping depends on the surrounding context of
the expression. A closure expression is nonescaping if it’s called immediately
or passed as a nonescaping function argument. Otherwise, the closure
expression is escaping.

For more information about escaping closures, see [Escaping Closures](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/closures#Escaping-Closures).

#### [Capture Lists](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Capture-Lists)

By default, a closure expression captures constants and variables from its
surrounding scope with strong references to those values. You can use a
_capture list_ to explicitly control how values are captured in a closure.

A capture list is written as a comma-separated list of expressions surrounded
by square brackets, before the list of parameters. If you use a capture list,
you must also use the `in` keyword, even if you omit the parameter names,
parameter types, and return type.

The entries in the capture list are initialized when the closure is created.
For each entry in the capture list, a constant is initialized to the value of
the constant or variable that has the same name in the surrounding scope. For
example in the code below, `a` is included in the capture list but `b` is not,
which gives them different behavior.

    
    
    var a = 0
    var b = 0
    let closure = { [a] in
     print(a, b)
    }
    
    
    a = 10
    b = 10
    closure()
    // Prints "0 10"
    

There are two different things named `a`, the variable in the surrounding
scope and the constant in the closure’s scope, but only one variable named
`b`. The `a` in the inner scope is initialized with the value of the `a` in
the outer scope when the closure is created, but their values aren’t connected
in any special way. This means that a change to the value of `a` in the outer
scope doesn’t affect the value of `a` in the inner scope, nor does a change to
`a` inside the closure affect the value of `a` outside the closure. In
contrast, there’s only one variable named `b` — the `b` in the outer scope —
so changes from inside or outside the closure are visible in both places.

This distinction isn’t visible when the captured variable’s type has reference
semantics. For example, there are two things named `x` in the code below, a
variable in the outer scope and a constant in the inner scope, but they both
refer to the same object because of reference semantics.

    
    
    class SimpleClass {
        var value: Int = 0
    }
    var x = SimpleClass()
    var y = SimpleClass()
    let closure = { [x] in
        print(x.value, y.value)
    }
    
    
    x.value = 10
    y.value = 10
    closure()
    // Prints "10 10"
    

If the type of the expression’s value is a class, you can mark the expression
in a capture list with `weak` or `unowned` to capture a weak or unowned
reference to the expression’s value.

    
    
    myFunction { print(self.title) }                    // implicit strong capture
    myFunction { [self] in print(self.title) }          // explicit strong capture
    myFunction { [weak self] in print(self!.title) }    // weak capture
    myFunction { [unowned self] in print(self.title) }  // unowned capture
    

You can also bind an arbitrary expression to a named value in a capture list.
The expression is evaluated when the closure is created, and the value is
captured with the specified strength. For example:

    
    
    // Weak capture of "self.parent" as "parent"
    myFunction { [weak parent = self.parent] in print(parent!.title) }

### [Implicit Member Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/expressions/#Implicit-Member-Expression)

An _implicit member expression_ is an abbreviated way to access a member of a
type, such as an enumeration case or a type method, in a context where type
inference can determine the implied type. It has the following form:

    
    
    .<#member name#>
    

For example:

    
    
    var x = MyEnumeration.someValue
    x = .anotherValue
    

If the inferred type is an optional, you can also use a member of the non-
optional type in an implicit member expression.

    
    
    var someOptional: MyEnumeration? = .someValue
    

Implicit member expressions can be followed by a postfix operator or other
postfix syntax listed in [Postfix Expressions](/swift-book/documentation/the-
swift-programming-language/expressions#Postfix-Expressions). This is called a
_chained implicit member expression_. Although it’s common for all of the
chained postfix expressions to have the same type, the only requirement is
that the whole chained implicit member expression needs to be convertible to
the type implied by its context. Specifically, if the implied type is an
optional you can use a value of the non-optional type, and if the implied type
is a class type you can use a value of one of its subclasses. For example:

    
    
    class SomeClass {
        static var shared = SomeClass()
        static var sharedSubclass = SomeSubclass()
        var a = AnotherClass()
    }
    class SomeSubclass: SomeClass { }
    class AnotherClass {
        static var s = SomeClass()
        func f() -> SomeClass { return AnotherClass.s }
    }
    let x: SomeClass = .shared.a.f()
    let y: SomeClass? = .shared
    let z: SomeClass = .sharedSubclass
    

In the code above, the type of `x` matches the type implied by its context
exactly, the type of `y` is convertible from `SomeClass` to `SomeClass?`, and
the type of `z` is convertible from `SomeSubclass` to `SomeClass`.

### [Parenthesized Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/expressions/#Parenthesized-Expression)

A _parenthesized expression_ consists of an expression surrounded by
parentheses. You can use parentheses to specify the precedence of operations
by explicitly grouping expressions. Grouping parentheses don’t change an
expression’s type — for example, the type of `(1)` is simply `Int`.

Grammar of a parenthesized expression

 _parenthesized-expression_ → **`(`** _expression_ **`)`**

### [Tuple Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Tuple-Expression)

A _tuple expression_ consists of a comma-separated list of expressions
surrounded by parentheses. Each expression can have an optional identifier
before it, separated by a colon (`:`). It has the following form:

    
    
    (<#identifier 1#>: <#expression 1#>, <#identifier 2#>: <#expression 2#>, <#...#>)
    

Each identifier in a tuple expression must be unique within the scope of the
tuple expression. In a nested tuple expression, identifiers at the same level
of nesting must be unique. For example, `(a: 10, a: 20)` is invalid because
the label `a` appears twice at the same level. However, `(a: 10, b: (a: 1, x:
2))` is valid — although `a` appears twice, it appears once in the outer tuple
and once in the inner tuple.

A tuple expression can contain zero expressions, or it can contain two or more
expressions. A single expression inside parentheses is a parenthesized
expression.

Note

Both an empty tuple expression and an empty tuple type are written `()` in
Swift. Because `Void` is a type alias for `()`, you can use it to write an
empty tuple type. However, like all type aliases, `Void` is always a type —
you can’t use it to write an empty tuple expression.

 _tuple-expression_ → **`(`** **`)`** | **`(`** _tuple-element_ **`,`** _tuple-element-list_ **`)`**   
_tuple-element-list_ → _tuple-element_ | _tuple-element_ **`,`** _tuple-element-list_   
_tuple-element_ → _expression_ | _identifier_ **`:`** _expression_

### [Wildcard Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Wildcard-Expression)

A _wildcard expression_ is used to explicitly ignore a value during an
assignment. For example, in the following assignment 10 is assigned to `x` and
20 is ignored:

    
    
    (x, _) = (10, 20)
    // x is 10, and 20 is ignored
    

Grammar of a wildcard expression

 _wildcard-expression_ → **`_`**

### [Macro-Expansion Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/expressions/#Macro-Expansion-Expression)

A _macro-expansion expression_ consists of a macro name followed by a comma-
separated list of the macro’s arguments in parentheses. The macro is expanded
at compile time. Macro-expansion expressions have the following form:

    
    
    <#macro name#>(<#macro argument 1#>, <#macro argument 2#>)
    

A macro-expansion expression omits the parentheses after the macro’s name if
the macro doesn’t take any arguments.

A macro-expansion expression can appear as the default value for a parameter.
When used as the default value of a function or method parameter, macros are
evaluated using the source code location of the call site, not the location
where they appear in a function definition. However, when a default value is a
larger expression that contains a macro in addition to other code, those
macros are evaluated where they appear in the function definition.

    
    
    func f(a: Int = #line, b: Int = (#line), c: Int = 100 + #line) {
        print(a, b, c)
    }
    f()  // Prints "4 1 101"
    

In the function above, the default value for `a` is a single macro expression,
so that macro is evaluated using the source code location where `f(a:b:c:)` is
called. In contrast, the values for `b` and `c` are expressions that contain a
macro — the macros in those expressions are evaluated using the source code
location where `f(a:b:c:)` is defined.

When you use a macro as a default value, it’s type checked without expanding
the macro, to check the following requirements:

  * The macro’s access level is the same as or less restrictive than the function that uses it.

  * The macro either takes no arguments, or its arguments are literals without string interpolation.

  * The macro’s return type matches the parameter’s type.

You use macro expressions to call freestanding macros. To call an attached
macro, use the custom attribute syntax described in [Attributes](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/attributes). Both
freestanding and attached macros expand as follows:

  1. Swift parses the source code to produce an abstract syntax tree (AST).

  2. The macro implementation receives AST nodes as its input and performs the transformations needed by that macro.

  3. The transformed AST nodes that the macro implementation produced are added to the original AST.

The expansion of each macro is independent and self-contained. However, as a
performance optimization, Swift might start an external process that
implements the macro and reuse the same process to expand multiple macros.
When you implement a macro, that code must not depend on what macros your code
previously expanded, or on any other external state like the current time.

For nested macros and attached macros that have multiple roles, the expansion
process repeats. Nested macro-expansion expressions expand from the outside
in. For example, in the code below `outerMacro(_:)` expands first and the
unexpanded call to `innerMacro(_:)` appears in the abstract syntax tree that
`outerMacro(_:)` receives as its input.

    
    
    #outerMacro(12, #innerMacro(34), "some text")
    

An attached macro that has multiple roles expands once for each role. Each
expansion receives the same, original, AST as its input. Swift forms the
overall expansion by collecting all of the generated AST nodes and putting
them in their corresponding places in the AST.

For an overview of macros in Swift, see [Macros](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/macros).

### [Key-Path Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Key-Path-Expression)

A _key-path expression_ refers to a property or subscript of a type. You use
key-path expressions in dynamic programming tasks, such as key-value
observing. They have the following form:

    
    
    \<#type name#>.<#path#>
    

The _type name_ is the name of a concrete type, including any generic
parameters, such as `String`, `[Int]`, or `Set<Int>`.

The _path_ consists of property names, subscripts, optional-chaining
expressions, and forced unwrapping expressions. Each of these key-path
components can be repeated as many times as needed, in any order.

At compile time, a key-path expression is replaced by an instance of the
[`KeyPath`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/keypath) class.

To access a value using a key path, pass the key path to the
`subscript(keyPath:)` subscript, which is available on all types. For example:

    
    
    struct SomeStructure {
        var someValue: Int
    }
    
    
    let s = SomeStructure(someValue: 12)
    let pathToProperty = \SomeStructure.someValue
    
    
    let value = s[keyPath: pathToProperty]
    // value is 12
    

The _type name_ can be omitted in contexts where type inference can determine
the implied type. The following code uses `\.someProperty` instead of
`\SomeClass.someProperty`:

    
    
    class SomeClass: NSObject {
        @objc dynamic var someProperty: Int
        init(someProperty: Int) {
            self.someProperty = someProperty
        }
    }
    
    
    let c = SomeClass(someProperty: 10)
    c.observe(\.someProperty) { object, change in
        // ...
    }
    

The _path_ can refer to `self` to create the identity key path (`\.self`). The
identity key path refers to a whole instance, so you can use it to access and
change all of the data stored in a variable in a single step. For example:

    
    
    var compoundValue = (a: 1, b: 2)
    // Equivalent to compoundValue = (a: 10, b: 20)
    compoundValue[keyPath: \.self] = (a: 10, b: 20)
    

The _path_ can contain multiple property names, separated by periods, to refer
to a property of a property’s value. This code uses the key path expression
`\OuterStructure.outer.someValue` to access the `someValue` property of the
`OuterStructure` type’s `outer` property:

    
    
    struct OuterStructure {
        var outer: SomeStructure
        init(someValue: Int) {
            self.outer = SomeStructure(someValue: someValue)
        }
    }
    
    
    let nested = OuterStructure(someValue: 24)
    let nestedKeyPath = \OuterStructure.outer.someValue
    
    
    let nestedValue = nested[keyPath: nestedKeyPath]
    // nestedValue is 24
    

The _path_ can include subscripts using brackets, as long as the subscript’s
parameter type conforms to the `Hashable` protocol. This example uses a
subscript in a key path to access the second element of an array:

    
    
    let greetings = ["hello", "hola", "bonjour", "안녕"]
    let myGreeting = greetings[keyPath: \[String].[1]]
    // myGreeting is 'hola'
    

The value used in a subscript can be a named value or a literal. Values are
captured in key paths using value semantics. The following code uses the
variable `index` in both a key-path expression and in a closure to access the
third element of the `greetings` array. When `index` is modified, the key-path
expression still references the third element, while the closure uses the new
index.

    
    
    var index = 2
    let path = \[String].[index]
    let fn: ([String]) -> String = { strings in strings[index] }
    
    
    print(greetings[keyPath: path])
    // Prints "bonjour"
    print(fn(greetings))
    // Prints "bonjour"
    
    
    // Setting 'index' to a new value doesn't affect 'path'
    index += 1
    print(greetings[keyPath: path])
    // Prints "bonjour"
    
    
    // Because 'fn' closes over 'index', it uses the new value
    print(fn(greetings))
    // Prints "안녕"
    

The _path_ can use optional chaining and forced unwrapping. This code uses
optional chaining in a key path to access a property of an optional string:

    
    
    let firstGreeting: String? = greetings.first
    print(firstGreeting?.count as Any)
    // Prints "Optional(5)"
    
    
    // Do the same thing using a key path.
    let count = greetings[keyPath: \[String].first?.count]
    print(count as Any)
    // Prints "Optional(5)"
    

You can mix and match components of key paths to access values that are deeply
nested within a type. The following code accesses different values and
properties of a dictionary of arrays by using key-path expressions that
combine these components.

    
    
    let interestingNumbers = ["prime": [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17],
                              "triangular": [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28],
                              "hexagonal": [1, 6, 15, 28, 45, 66, 91]]
    print(interestingNumbers[keyPath: \[String: [Int]].["prime"]] as Any)
    // Prints "Optional([2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17])"
    print(interestingNumbers[keyPath: \[String: [Int]].["prime"]![0]])
    // Prints "2"
    print(interestingNumbers[keyPath: \[String: [Int]].["hexagonal"]!.count])
    // Prints "7"
    print(interestingNumbers[keyPath: \[String: [Int]].["hexagonal"]!.count.bitWidth])
    // Prints "64"
    

You can use a key path expression in contexts where you would normally provide
a function or closure. Specifically, you can use a key path expression whose
root type is `SomeType` and whose path produces a value of type `Value`,
instead of a function or closure of type `(SomeType) -> Value`.

    
    
    struct Task {
        var description: String
        var completed: Bool
    }
    var toDoList = [
        Task(description: "Practice ping-pong.", completed: false),
        Task(description: "Buy a pirate costume.", completed: true),
        Task(description: "Visit Boston in the Fall.", completed: false),
    ]
    
    
    // Both approaches below are equivalent.
    let descriptions = toDoList.filter(\.completed).map(\.description)
    let descriptions2 = toDoList.filter { $0.completed }.map { $0.description }
    

Any side effects of a key path expression are evaluated only at the point
where the expression is evaluated. For example, if you make a function call
inside a subscript in a key path expression, the function is called only once
as part of evaluating the expression, not every time the key path is used.

    
    
    func makeIndex() -> Int {
        print("Made an index")
        return 0
    }
    // The line below calls makeIndex().
    let taskKeyPath = \[Task][makeIndex()]
    // Prints "Made an index"
    
    
    // Using taskKeyPath doesn't call makeIndex() again.
    let someTask = toDoList[keyPath: taskKeyPath]

### [Selector Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Selector-Expression)

A selector expression lets you access the selector used to refer to a method
or to a property’s getter or setter in Objective-C. It has the following form:

    
    
    #selector(<#method name#>)
    #selector(getter: <#property name#>)
    #selector(setter: <#property name#>)
    

The _method name_ and _property name_ must be a reference to a method or a
property that’s available in the Objective-C runtime. The value of a selector
expression is an instance of the `Selector` type. For example:

    
    
    class SomeClass: NSObject {
        @objc let property: String
    
    
        @objc(doSomethingWithInt:)
        func doSomething(_ x: Int) { }
    
    
        init(property: String) {
            self.property = property
        }
    }
    let selectorForMethod = #selector(SomeClass.doSomething(_:))
    let selectorForPropertyGetter = #selector(getter: SomeClass.property)
    

When creating a selector for a property’s getter, the _property name_ can be a
reference to a variable or constant property. In contrast, when creating a
selector for a property’s setter, the _property name_ must be a reference to a
variable property only.

The _method name_ can contain parentheses for grouping, as well the `as`
operator to disambiguate between methods that share a name but have different
type signatures. For example:

    
    
    extension SomeClass {
        @objc(doSomethingWithString:)
        func doSomething(_ x: String) { }
    }
    let anotherSelector = #selector(SomeClass.doSomething(_:) as (SomeClass) -> (String) -> Void)
    

Because a selector is created at compile time, not at runtime, the compiler
can check that a method or property exists and that they’re exposed to the
Objective-C runtime.

Note

Although the _method name_ and the _property name_ are expressions, they’re
never evaluated.

For more information about using selectors in Swift code that interacts with
Objective-C APIs, see [Using Objective-C Runtime Features in
Swift](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/using_objective_c_runtime_features_in_swift).

### [Key-Path String Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/expressions/#Key-Path-String-Expression)

A key-path string expression lets you access the string used to refer to a
property in Objective-C, for use in key-value coding and key-value observing
APIs. It has the following form:

    
    
    #keyPath(<#property name#>)
    

The _property name_ must be a reference to a property that’s available in the
Objective-C runtime. At compile time, the key-path string expression is
replaced by a string literal. For example:

    
    
    class SomeClass: NSObject {
        @objc var someProperty: Int
        init(someProperty: Int) {
           self.someProperty = someProperty
        }
    }
    
    
    let c = SomeClass(someProperty: 12)
    let keyPath = #keyPath(SomeClass.someProperty)
    
    
    if let value = c.value(forKey: keyPath) {
        print(value)
    }
    // Prints "12"
    

When you use a key-path string expression within a class, you can refer to a
property of that class by writing just the property name, without the class
name.

    
    
    extension SomeClass {
        func getSomeKeyPath() -> String {
            return #keyPath(someProperty)
        }
    }
    print(keyPath == c.getSomeKeyPath())
    // Prints "true"
    

Because the key path string is created at compile time, not at runtime, the
compiler can check that the property exists and that the property is exposed

## [Postfix Expressions](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Postfix-Expressions)

 _Postfix expressions_ are formed by applying a postfix operator or other
postfix syntax to an expression. Syntactically, every primary expression is
also a postfix expression.

For information about the behavior of these operators, see [Basic
Operators](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/basicoperators) and [Advanced Operators](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/advancedoperators).

For information about the operators provided by the Swift standard library,
see [Operator
Declarations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/operator_declarations).

### [Function Call Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/expressions/#Function-Call-Expression)

A _function call expression_ consists of a function name followed by a comma-
separated list of the function’s arguments in parentheses. Function call
expressions have the following form:

    
    
    <#function name#>(<#argument value 1#>, <#argument value 2#>)
    

The _function name_ can be any expression whose value is of a function type.

If the function definition includes names for its parameters, the function
call must include names before its argument values, separated by a colon
(`:`). This kind of function call expression has the following form:

    
    
    <#function name#>(<#argument name 1#>: <#argument value 1#>, <#argument name 2#>: <#argument value 2#>)
    

A function call expression can include trailing closures in the form of
closure expressions immediately after the closing parenthesis. The trailing
closures are understood as arguments to the function, added after the last
parenthesized argument. The first closure expression is unlabeled; any
additional closure expressions are preceded by their argument labels. The
example below shows the equivalent version of function calls that do and don’t
use trailing closure syntax:

    
    
    // someFunction takes an integer and a closure as its arguments
    someFunction(x: x, f: { $0 == 13 })
    someFunction(x: x) { $0 == 13 }
    
    
    // anotherFunction takes an integer and two closures as its arguments
    anotherFunction(x: x, f: { $0 == 13 }, g: { print(99) })
    anotherFunction(x: x) { $0 == 13 } g: { print(99) }
    

If the trailing closure is the function’s only argument, you can omit the
parentheses.

    
    
    // someMethod takes a closure as its only argument
    myData.someMethod() { $0 == 13 }
    myData.someMethod { $0 == 13 }
    

To include the trailing closures in the arguments, the compiler examines the
function’s parameters from left to right as follows:

Trailing Closure| Parameter| Action  
---|---|---  
Labeled| Labeled| If the labels are the same, the closure matches the
parameter; otherwise, the parameter is skipped.  
Labeled| Unlabeled| The parameter is skipped.  
Unlabeled| Labeled or unlabeled| If the parameter structurally resembles a
function type, as defined below, the closure matches the parameter; otherwise,
the parameter is skipped.  
  
The trailing closure is passed as the argument for the parameter that it
matches. Parameters that were skipped during the scanning process don’t have
an argument passed to them — for example, they can use a default parameter.
After finding a match, scanning continues with the next trailing closure and
the next parameter. At the end of the matching process, all trailing closures
must have a match.

A parameter _structurally resembles_ a function type if the parameter isn’t an
in-out parameter, and the parameter is one of the following:

  * A parameter whose type is a function type, like `(Bool) -> Int`

  * An autoclosure parameter whose wrapped expression’s type is a function type, like `@autoclosure () -> ((Bool) -> Int)`

  * A variadic parameter whose array element type is a function type, like `((Bool) -> Int)...`

  * A parameter whose type is wrapped in one or more layers of optional, like `Optional<(Bool) -> Int>`

  * A parameter whose type combines these allowed types, like `(Optional<(Bool) -> Int>)...`

When a trailing closure is matched to a parameter whose type structurally
resembles a function type, but isn’t a function, the closure is wrapped as
needed. For example, if the parameter’s type is an optional type, the closure
is wrapped in `Optional` automatically.

To ease migration of code from versions of Swift prior to 5.3 — which
performed this matching from right to left — the compiler checks both the
left-to-right and right-to-left orderings. If the scan directions produce
different results, the old right-to-left ordering is used and the compiler
generates a warning. A future version of Swift will always use the left-to-
right ordering.

    
    
    typealias Callback = (Int) -> Int
    func someFunction(firstClosure: Callback? = nil,
                    secondClosure: Callback? = nil) {
        let first = firstClosure?(10)
        let second = secondClosure?(20)
        print(first ?? "-", second ?? "-")
    }
    
    
    someFunction()  // Prints "- -"
    someFunction { return $0 + 100 }  // Ambiguous
    someFunction { return $0 } secondClosure: { return $0 }  // Prints "10 20"
    

In the example above, the function call marked “Ambiguous” prints “- 120” and
produces a compiler warning on Swift 5.3. A future version of Swift will print
“110 -”.

A class, structure, or enumeration type can enable syntactic sugar for
function call syntax by declaring one of several methods, as described in
[Methods with Special Names](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/declarations#Methods-with-Special-Names).

#### [Implicit Conversion to a Pointer Type](/swift-book/documentation/the-
swift-programming-language/expressions/#Implicit-Conversion-to-a-Pointer-Type)

In a function call expression, if the argument and parameter have a different
type, the compiler tries to make their types match by applying one of the
implicit conversions in the following list:

  * `inout SomeType` can become `UnsafePointer<SomeType>` or `UnsafeMutablePointer<SomeType>`

  * `inout Array<SomeType>` can become `UnsafePointer<SomeType>` or `UnsafeMutablePointer<SomeType>`

  * `Array<SomeType>` can become `UnsafePointer<SomeType>`

  * `String` can become `UnsafePointer<CChar>`

The following two function calls are equivalent:

    
    
    func unsafeFunction(pointer: UnsafePointer<Int>) {
        // ...
    }
    var myNumber = 1234
    
    
    unsafeFunction(pointer: &myNumber)
    withUnsafePointer(to: myNumber) { unsafeFunction(pointer: $0) }
    

A pointer that’s created by these implicit conversions is valid only for the
duration of the function call. To avoid undefined behavior, ensure that your
code never persists the pointer after the function call ends.

Note

When implicitly converting an array to an unsafe pointer, Swift ensures that
the array’s storage is contiguous by converting or copying the array as
needed. For example, you can use this syntax with an array that was bridged to
`Array` from an `NSArray` subclass that makes no API contract about its
storage. If you need to guarantee that the array’s storage is already
contiguous, so the implicit conversion never needs to do this work, use
`ContiguousArray` instead of `Array`.

Using `&` instead of an explicit function like `withUnsafePointer(to:)` can
help make calls to low-level C functions more readable, especially when the
function takes several pointer arguments. However, when calling functions from
other Swift code, avoid using `&` instead of using the unsafe APIs explicitly.

### [Initializer Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Initializer-Expression)

An _initializer expression_ provides access to a type’s initializer. It has
the following form:

    
    
    <#expression#>.init(<#initializer arguments#>)
    

You use the initializer expression in a function call expression to initialize
a new instance of a type. You also use an initializer expression to delegate
to the initializer of a superclass.

    
    
    class SomeSubClass: SomeSuperClass {
        override init() {
            // subclass initialization goes here
            super.init()
        }
    }
    

Like a function, an initializer can be used as a value. For example:

    
    
    // Type annotation is required because String has multiple initializers.
    let initializer: (Int) -> String = String.init
    let oneTwoThree = [1, 2, 3].map(initializer).reduce("", +)
    print(oneTwoThree)
    // Prints "123"
    

If you specify a type by name, you can access the type’s initializer without
using an initializer expression. In all other cases, you must use an
initializer expression.

    
    
    let s1 = SomeType.init(data: 3)  // Valid
    let s2 = SomeType(data: 1)       // Also valid
    
    
    let s3 = type(of: someValue).init(data: 7)  // Valid
    let s4 = type(of: someValue)(data: 5)       // Error

### [Explicit Member Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/expressions/#Explicit-Member-Expression)

An _explicit member expression_ allows access to the members of a named type,
a tuple, or a module. It consists of a period (`.`) between the item and the
identifier of its member.

    
    
    <#expression#>.<#member name#>
    

The members of a named type are named as part of the type’s declaration or
extension. For example:

    
    
    class SomeClass {
        var someProperty = 42
    }
    let c = SomeClass()
    let y = c.someProperty  // Member access
    

The members of a tuple are implicitly named using integers in the order they
appear, starting from zero. For example:

    
    
    var t = (10, 20, 30)
    t.0 = t.1
    // Now t is (20, 20, 30)
    

The members of a module access the top-level declarations of that module.

Types declared with the `dynamicMemberLookup` attribute include members that
are looked up at runtime, as described in [Attributes](/swift-
book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/attributes).

To distinguish between methods or initializers whose names differ only by the
names of their arguments, include the argument names in parentheses, with each
argument name followed by a colon (`:`). Write an underscore (`_`) for an
argument with no name. To distinguish between overloaded methods, use a type
annotation. For example:

    
    
    class SomeClass {
        func someMethod(x: Int, y: Int) {}
        func someMethod(x: Int, z: Int) {}
        func overloadedMethod(x: Int, y: Int) {}
        func overloadedMethod(x: Int, y: Bool) {}
    }
    let instance = SomeClass()
    
    
    let a = instance.someMethod              // Ambiguous
    let b = instance.someMethod(x:y:)        // Unambiguous
    
    
    let d = instance.overloadedMethod        // Ambiguous
    let d = instance.overloadedMethod(x:y:)  // Still ambiguous
    let d: (Int, Bool) -> Void  = instance.overloadedMethod(x:y:)  // Unambiguous
    

If a period appears at the beginning of a line, it’s understood as part of an
explicit member expression, not as an implicit member expression. For example,
the following listing shows chained method calls split over several lines:

    
    
    let x = [10, 3, 20, 15, 4]
        .sorted()
        .filter { $0 > 5 }
        .map { $0 * 100 }
    

You can combine this multiline chained syntax with compiler control statements
to control when each method is called. For example, the following code uses a
different filtering rule on iOS:

    
    
    let numbers = [10, 20, 33, 43, 50]
    #if os(iOS)
        .filter { $0 < 40 }
    #else
        .filter { $0 > 25 }
    #endif
    

Between `#if`, `#endif`, and other compilation directives, the conditional
compilation block can contain an implicit member expression followed by zero
or more postfixes, to form a postfix expression. It can also contain another
conditional compilation block, or a combination of these expressions and
blocks.

You can use this syntax anywhere that you can write an explicit member
expression, not just in top-level code.

In the conditional compilation block, the branch for the `#if` compilation
directive must contain at least one expression. The other branches can be
empty.

### [Postfix Self Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Postfix-Self-Expression)

A postfix `self` expression consists of an expression or the name of a type,
immediately followed by `.self`. It has the following forms:

    
    
    <#expression#>.self
    <#type#>.self
    

The first form evaluates to the value of the _expression_. For example,
`x.self` evaluates to `x`.

The second form evaluates to the value of the _type_. Use this form to access
a type as a value. For example, because `SomeClass.self` evaluates to the
`SomeClass` type itself, you can pass it to a function or method that accepts
a type-level argument.

### [Subscript Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Subscript-Expression)

A _subscript expression_ provides subscript access using the getter and setter
of the corresponding subscript declaration. It has the following form:

    
    
    <#expression#>[<#index expressions#>]
    

To evaluate the value of a subscript expression, the subscript getter for the
_expression_ ’s type is called with the _index expressions_ passed as the
subscript parameters. To set its value, the subscript setter is called in the
same way.

For information about subscript declarations, see [Protocol Subscript
Declaration](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/declarations#Protocol-Subscript-Declaration).

### [Forced-Value Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions/#Forced-Value-Expression)

A _forced-value expression_ unwraps an optional value that you are certain
isn’t `nil`. It has the following form:

    
    
    <#expression#>!
    

If the value of the _expression_ isn’t `nil`, the optional value is unwrapped
and returned with the corresponding non-optional type. Otherwise, a runtime
error is raised.

The unwrapped value of a forced-value expression can be modified, either by
mutating the value itself, or by assigning to one of the value’s members. For
example:

    
    
    var x: Int? = 0
    x! += 1
    // x is now 1
    
    
    var someDictionary = ["a": [1, 2, 3], "b": [10, 20]]
    someDictionary["a"]![0] = 100
    // someDictionary is now ["a": [100, 2, 3], "b": [10, 20]]

 _forced-value-expression_ → _postfix-expression_ **`!`**

### [Optional-Chaining Expression](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/expressions/#Optional-Chaining-Expression)

An _optional-chaining expression_ provides a simplified syntax for using
optional values in postfix expressions. It has the following form:

    
    
    <#expression#>?
    

The postfix `?` operator makes an optional-chaining expression from an
expression without changing the expression’s value.

Optional-chaining expressions must appear within a postfix expression, and
they cause the postfix expression to be evaluated in a special way. If the
value of the optional-chaining expression is `nil`, all of the other
operations in the postfix expression are ignored and the entire postfix
expression evaluates to `nil`. If the value of the optional-chaining
expression isn’t `nil`, the value of the optional-chaining expression is
unwrapped and used to evaluate the rest of the postfix expression. In either
case, the value of the postfix expression is still of an optional type.

If a postfix expression that contains an optional-chaining expression is
nested inside other postfix expressions, only the outermost expression returns
an optional type. In the example below, when `c` isn’t `nil`, its value is
unwrapped and used to evaluate `.property`, the value of which is used to
evaluate `.performAction()`. The entire expression
`c?.property.performAction()` has a value of an optional type.

    
    
    var c: SomeClass?
    var result: Bool? = c?.property.performAction()
    

The following example shows the behavior of the example above without using
optional chaining.

    
    
    var result: Bool?
    if let unwrappedC = c {
        result = unwrappedC.property.performAction()
    }
    

The unwrapped value of an optional-chaining expression can be modified, either
by mutating the value itself, or by assigning to one of the value’s members.
If the value of the optional-chaining expression is `nil`, the expression on
the right-hand side of the assignment operator isn’t evaluated. For example:

    
    
    func someFunctionWithSideEffects() -> Int {
        return 42  // No actual side effects.
    }
    var someDictionary = ["a": [1, 2, 3], "b": [10, 20]]
    
    
    someDictionary["not here"]?[0] = someFunctionWithSideEffects()
    // someFunctionWithSideEffects isn't evaluated
    // someDictionary is still ["a": [1, 2, 3], "b": [10, 20]]
    
    
    someDictionary["a"]?[0] = someFunctionWithSideEffects()
    // someFunctionWithSideEffects is evaluated and returns 42
    // someDictionary is now ["a": [42, 2, 3], "b": [10, 20]]
