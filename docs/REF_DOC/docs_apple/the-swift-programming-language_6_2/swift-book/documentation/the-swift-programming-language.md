Determine a value’s runtime type and give it more specific type information.

[Nested Types](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/nestedtypes)

Define types inside the scope of another type.

[Extensions](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/extensions)

Add functionality to an existing type.

[Protocols](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/protocols)

Define requirements that conforming types must implement.

[Generics](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/generics)

Write code that works for multiple types and specify requirements for those
types.

[Opaque and Boxed Protocol Types](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/opaquetypes)

Hide implementation details about a value’s type.

[Automatic Reference Counting](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/automaticreferencecounting)

Model the lifetime of objects and their relationships.

[Memory Safety](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/memorysafety)

Structure your code to avoid conflicts when accessing memory.

[Access Control](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/accesscontrol)

Manage the visibility of code by declaration, file, and module.

[Advanced Operators](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/advancedoperators)

Define custom operators, perform bitwise operations, and use builder syntax.

### [Language Reference](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/#Language-Reference)

[About the Language Reference](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-
programming-language/aboutthelanguagereference)

Read the notation that the formal grammar uses.

[Lexical Structure](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/lexicalstructure)

Use the lowest-level components of the syntax.

[Types](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/types)

Use built-in named and compound types.

[Expressions](/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-
language/expressions)
