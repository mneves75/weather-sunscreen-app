# HealthKit

HealthKit is now available on Apple Vision Pro, giving you new ways to create
innovative health and fitness experiences that take advantage of the infinite
canvas in visionOS. And new APIs for mental health and wellbeing let you help
your users track their emotions and moods, as well as understand their risk
for depression or anxiety.
