# Advanced Commerce API

Support In-App Purchases through the App Store for exceptionally large
catalogs of custom one-time purchases, subscriptions, and subscriptions with
optional add-ons.

Advanced Commerce API 1.0+

## [Overview](/documentation/AdvancedCommerceAPI#Overview)

Use this framework to offer an exceptionally large catalog of one-time
purchases, subscriptions, and subscriptions with optional add-ons while using
the App Store commerce system. Apps that use this API host and manage their
own catalog of In-App Purchases, or SKUs. The App Store commerce system
handles the end-to-end payment processing, global distribution, tax support,
and customer service.

You can use the Advanced Commerce API and the StoreKit [In-App
Purchase](/documentation/StoreKit/in-app-purchase) API in the same app. Both
APIs use the App Store commerce system, including the same signed JWS
transactions and JWS renewal info. For products that you offer using the In-
App Purchase API, you set up product identifiers in App Store Connect. For
products that you offer using the Advanced Commerce API, you host and manage
your own catalog of SKUs and add product details dynamically at runtime. For
complete setup information, see [Setting up your project for Advanced Commerce
API](/documentation/advancedcommerceapi/setting-up-your-project-for-advanced-
commerce).

Advanced Commerce API features are available through requests you make using
StoreKit in your app and endpoint requests from your server. To authorize
these requests, you generate JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). The App Store Server
Library provides a client that makes it easier to create JWTs to authorize
calls. For more information about the library, see [Simplifying your
implementation by using the App Store Server
Library](/documentation/AppStoreServerAPI/simplifying-your-implementation-by-
using-the-app-store-server-library). For more information about authorizing
calls, see [Authorizing API requests from your
server](/documentation/advancedcommerceapi/authorizing-server-calls).

Your server must support the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol 1.2 or
later to call the Advanced Commerce API.
