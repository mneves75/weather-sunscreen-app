developer’s website.

## Installing apps from the web

Starting with iOS 18.6 and iPadOS 18.6, iOS and iPadOS will provide an updated
user experience in the EU for installing an app from a developer’s website.

The first time a user installs an app from the web from a particular developer
will have this user experience:

Subsequent installs of apps from the web from that same developer will have
this user experience:

## Installing a developer’s own apps via the web

Later this year, we will provide an API which will allow developers to
initiate the download of alternatively distributed apps they publish from
within their app.

The first time a developer initiates the download of an alternatively
distributed app they have published from within their own app, the user
experience will look like this:
