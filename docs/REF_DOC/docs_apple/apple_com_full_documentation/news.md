## New features for APNs token authentication are now available

February 17, 2025

You can now take advantage of upgraded security options when creating new
token authentication keys for the Apple Push Notification service (APNs).

**Team-scoped keys** enable you to restrict your token authentication keys to
either development or production environments, providing an additional layer
of security and ensuring that keys are used only in their intended
environments.

**Topic-specific keys** provide more granular control by enabling you to
associate each key with a specific bundle ID, allowing for more streamlined
and organized key management. This is particularly beneficial for large
organizations that manage multiple apps across different teams.

Your existing keys will continue to work for all push topics and environments.
At this time, you donâ€™t have to update your keys unless you want to take
advantage of the new capabilities.

APNs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/establishing-
a-token-based-connection-to-apns).
