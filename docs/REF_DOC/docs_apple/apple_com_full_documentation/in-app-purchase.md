# Simple and safe In-App Purchases

The App Store provides a powerful commerce system that makes it simple to
offer your content and services across Apple platforms to people around the
world. Facilitating billions of transactions annually, it handles end-to-end
payment processing — so you can focus on creating great apps and games that
people will love. Learn how to leverage world-class App Store commerce and
payment features to grow your business as you offer In-App Purchases
(including subscriptions).

## ![](/assets/elements/icons/symbols/checkmark-circle.svg)Checkout and
payment support

Developers have earned more than $300 billion through the App Store commerce
system since its launch in 2008. And the App Store receives more than half a
billion visitors every week, making it a great place to promote your In-App
Purchases.

### Effortless checkout

The App Store In-App Purchase system makes it simple for customers to purchase
your digital goods and services on the App Store and in your apps. When
creating an Apple Account, customers add a payment method that can be used to
make purchases. And with secure authentication using Face ID, Optic ID, or
Touch ID, customers can make purchases within your app in just a few taps —
minimizing abandoned purchases.

When a purchase is initiated, an App Store payment sheet displays relevant
details that help customers easily understand the transaction (like the type
of good or service, price, and subscription duration) before confirming their
purchase.

### Global payment reach

Apple handles worldwide end-to-end payment processing — from decrypting
payments, to validating tokens, to receiving payments — so you don’t have to
coordinate with multiple payment providers. Customers can pay with their
preferred regional method with support for more than 200 [payment
methods](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202631), including credit and debit
cards, carrier billing, digital wallets, and more.

To help you reach as many customers as possible in 175 regions, we
continuously add support for new payment methods.

### Powerful pricing tools

App Store tools make it convenient to manage In-App Purchase pricing across
international markets, so you can easily offer content and expand your
business worldwide.

**Regional availability options.** Choose the storefronts where you want to
make your In-App Purchases (including subscriptions) available, so you can
deliver content and services customized for each market.

**Flexible pricing.** Choose from 900 price points, ranging from United States
$0.29 to $10,000, with similar prices in each currency. Options follow the
most common pricing conventions in each country or region to make sure your
pricing is relevant to customers. You can also offer a custom price point
option in each storefront for an In-App Purchase, and set up custom prices for
a limited time period or indefinitely.

**Easy-to-set-pricing worldwide.** Specify a country or region you’re familiar
with as the basis for automatically generated prices across the other 174
regions in 43 currencies. Automatically generated prices are globally
equalized, accounting for taxes and foreign currency rates. Prices of apps and
In‑App Purchases (excluding auto-renewable subscriptions) are automatically
updated as taxes or foreign currency change. Prices in your base region and
any region with a custom price will never be adjusted by Apple.

### Taxes handled for you

Apple provides an automated system that handles the calculation, collection,
and remittance of transactional taxes (such as value added tax) and compliance
requirements in more than 80 regions, including most major markets, for your
app and In-App Purchases on the App Store. This makes it easy to sell your
digital goods and services globally. The system applies the correct tax rates
and regulations for each region based on the [tax category](/help/app-store-
connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/set-a-tax-category-for-in-app-
purchases/) assigned to your apps, such as videos, books, or news
publications. We seamlessly adapt tax changes into our commerce system.

### Payment collection

Customers are encouraged to provide multiple payment methods and if a billing
issue occurs with a given payment method, Apple attempts to collect using the
other methods. Further, Apple automatically updates payment instruments
whenever possible and when not possible, uses messaging and follow-ups to
encourage customers to resolve.

![](/in-app-purchase/images/icon-circlepath-twice.svg)

![](/in-app-purchase/images/icon-creditcard.svg)

![](/in-app-purchase/images/icon-checkmark-circle.svg)

If there’s a billing issue with an auto-renewable subscription, the App Store
will recover the vast majority of the subscription for you. In addition,
StoreKit displays a [Billing
Problem](/documentation/storekit/message/reason/4123328-billingissue) message
sheet (either when your app launches or when you’ve configured your app to
display it) that lets subscribers fix their billing issue without leaving your
app. Apple also notifies them of the issue via push notifications and in-app
messaging.

When you enable [Billing Grace Period](/help/app-store-connect/manage-
subscriptions/enable-billing-grace-period-for-auto-renewable-subscriptions/)
in App Store Connect, subscribers can continue to access your app’s paid
content for a period of time, all while Apple attempts to resolve the billing
issue. And if Apple recovers the subscription within the grace period, there’s
no lost revenue and no interruption to the subscriber's days of paid service.
[Learn more about offering subscriptions](/app-store/subscriptions/).

## ![](/assets/elements/icons/symbols/app-dashed.svg)Simple set-up

You can offer one or more types of In-App Purchases: consumable, non-
consumable, auto-renewable subscription, and non-renewing subscription. Set up
your In-App Purchases using App Store Connect, the StoreKit framework, and In-
App Purchase APIs to retrieve product information, process payments, and
deliver the product.

![](/in-app-purchase/images/screen-paywalls-medium_2x.png)

### Quick paywall creation

It’s easy to build intuitive payment experiences for In-App Purchases and
subscriptions using StoreKit views. With as little as one line of code,
StoreKit views clearly present the description, price, and duration for each
level of service. And with built-in localization support, In-App Purchase
details are displayed in the relevant language and currency, without any extra
development work. You can also customize [StoreKit
views](/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/storekit_views/) to match the
look and feel of your app.

### Up-to-date transaction statuses

Near-real time status updates for refunds, subscription state, Family Sharing
access, and more, are available through App Store Server Notifications. Use
this information to update your transaction records and create customized user
experiences. For example, if someone has turned off auto-renew, you might
display a promotional offer to encourage them to resubscribe. To enable App
Store Server Notifications, configure your server’s HTTPS URL in App Store
Connect.

And you can get the latest product entitlements and transaction updates using
the App Store Server API. Find out the latest status and history for In-App
Purchase transactions, including status changes that take place outside your
app.

  * [App Store Server API documentation](/documentation/appstoreserverapi/)

### Tools to help you test

Take advantage of testing tools throughout the development process so your app
and server can properly handle common purchase scenarios, like subscription
offers, interrupted purchases, and refunds. During early development, you can
simulate and test in‑app purchases using Xcode. After you configure your
in‑app purchases in App Store Connect, use the sandbox environment or StoreKit
Testing in Xcode to test using real product information.

When you’re ready for more people to help you test, TestFlight lets you gain
valuable feedback from internal and external testers. Invite up to 10,000
external testers using just their email addresses or by sharing a public link.
In‑app purchases in TestFlight use the sandbox environment, so they’re free to
testers and don’t carry over into production once your app is released on the
App Store.

Once you’re done testing, submit your In-App Purchases for review.

  * [Testing at all stages of development](/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/testing_at_all_stages_of_development_with_xcode_and_sandbox/)

## ![](/assets/elements/icons/symbols/rays.svg)Marketing and engagement
features

Once your In-App Purchases are published, you can promote them and encourage
engagement in different ways. [Learn more about promoting your apps](/app-
store/promote/).

### Promotion on the App Store

In iOS and iPadOS, people can browse In-App Purchases directly on the App
Store and start a purchase even before downloading your app. Promoted In-App
Purchases appear on your product page, can display in search results, and may
be featured on the Today, Games, and Apps tabs, helping you showcase your
content to a wide audience.

[Learn more](/app-store/promoting-in-app-purchases/)

### Subscription offers

Attract subscribers and keep them engaged with a discounted price or free
access for a specific duration of an auto-renewable subscription. Transactions
on the App Store are authenticated, so fraud opportunities — like multiple
free trials from a single account — are minimized.

[Learn more](/app-store/subscriptions/#providing-subscription-offers)

### In-App Events on the App Store

People can discover your events on the App Store in iOS and iPadOS, giving you
another way to expand their reach. If your event requires an In-App Purchase
or subscription to participate, it’s noted on the event details page.

[Learn more](/app-store/in-app-events/)

### Promo codes

Give press and influencers early access to your app or In-App Purchases with
promo codes. You can give away up to 100 promo codes for each version of your
app per platform and up to 100 promo codes per In-App Purchase.

[Learn more](/help/app-store-connect/offer-promo-codes/request-and-manage-
promo-codes/)

### App bundles

You can create app bundles for paid apps or free apps that offer auto-
renewable subscriptions. If an app offers a subscription, users can access it
across all apps included in the bundle.

[Learn more](/app-store/app-bundles/)

### Family Sharing

Apps that offer auto-renewable subscriptions or non-consumable In-App
Purchases can offer Family Sharing to let people share access with up to five
family members. Streamlined and convenient, Family Sharing can help you
attract subscribers, encourage paid subscriptions, increase engagement, and
improve retention.

on-family-sharing-for-in-app-purchases/)

## ![](/assets/elements/icons/symbols/chart-xyaxis-line.svg)Analytics and
reporting

Get a wide range of helpful metrics related to each of your In-App Purchases,
including sales, number of paying users, average proceeds per paying user, and
more. View your final proceeds for each month, earnings by location and
currency, rates used to convert your earnings from local currencies (when
available), as well as any applied taxes and adjustments. You can also

### Benchmark your performance

With peer group benchmarks in App Analytics, you can view how your app ranks
across key metrics compared to similar apps on the App Store. One of these
metrics is average proceeds per paying user, which can help you understand how
well your In-App Purchases are performing. Differential privacy techniques are
applied to peer groups to preserve privacy, so no sensitive developer
information is revealed and your data remains yours.

## ![](/assets/elements/icons/symbols/checkmark-shield.svg)Trust and safety

### Secure transactions and fraud detection

The App Store is a safe and trusted place for customers and developers, and we
work to keep it that way. From 2020 through 2023, Apple prevented a [combined
total of over $7 billion](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/app-store-
stopped-over-7-billion-usd-in-potentially-fraudulent-transactions/) in
potentially fraudulent transactions. We continually invest significant
resources in building more secure payment technologies, like Apple Pay and
StoreKit. For example, with Apple Pay, credit card numbers are never shared
with merchants — eliminating a risk factor in the payment transaction process.
And purchases are verified through password and biometric security in order to
prevent unauthorized use.

These protections are an essential part of keeping customers safe. But
customers may not realize that when their credit card information is breached
or stolen from another source, fraudsters may turn to online marketplaces like
the App Store to attempt to purchase digital goods and services that can be
laundered or used for illicit purposes. Apple focuses relentlessly on this
kind of fraud as well, with a fusion of sophisticated technology and human
review to prevent stolen cards from being used to make fraudulent purchases.

And Apple also takes action against fraudulent customer accounts, disabling
those associated with abusive activity and blocking fraudulent new accounts
before they can even be created.

### Customer support features

Thoughtful support helps you build trust with your users and can lead to
higher retention, improved engagement, and better ratings and reviews.
StoreKit and the App Store Server API help you provide more seamless support
options and resolve in‑app purchase issues quickly and efficiently.

#### Refund requests

Let people request refunds directly within your app by using the
[beginRefundRequest
API](/documentation/storekit/transaction/3803220-beginrefundrequest/) and
providing a dedicated place in your app for these requests. You can also
provide other options — such as technical support or in-app credits — before
the option to request a refund.

If youʼve enabled App Store Server Notifications, youʼll receive a
notification when someone receives a refund. You can use this information to
take action — for example, updating the account balance based on the refund or
restricting access to content unlocked by the In‑App Purchase. If you choose
to take action, inform the user of any changes and let them know if there’s
anything they need to do. You can also identify if someone previously received
refunds for any In‑App Purchases made in your app using the [Get Refund
History](/documentation/appstoreserverapi/get_refund_history/) endpoint.

Apple uses a variety of factors to determine whether a refund request is
approved or denied. To help inform and improve the refund process, you can
send information about a user’s In‑App Purchase (including auto-renewable
subscriptions) to Apple via the [Consumption
API](/documentation/appstoreserverapi/send_consumption_information) when they
request a refund (for example, if they used the In-App Purchase or you were
unable to deliver the purchase). Data is incorporated into our refund logic,
to help ensure flexible, accurate, and informed decision making.

  * [Refund request UI best practices](/design/human-interface-guidelines/in-app-purchase#Providing-help-with-in-app-purchases)
  * [Enabling App Store Server Notifications](/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/subscriptions_and_offers/enabling_server-to-server_notifications/)
  * [Handling refund notifications](/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/handling_refund_notifications/)
  * [Providing subscriber support](/app-store/subscriptions/#subscription-support)

#### Purchase management

If someone redownloads your app or switches to a new device, be sure to
immediately provide access to the content or functionality from their past
In‑App Purchases. Use the
[currentEntitlements](/documentation/storekit/transaction/3851204-currententitlements/)
property in StoreKit to understand a user’s entitlements and provide access
accordingly. Your app must also include a restore mechanism for any restorable
In‑App Purchases, per [App Review Guideline 3.1.1](/app-
store/review/guidelines/#3.1.1).

If someone requests support for an In‑App Purchase, you can use the [Look Up
Order ID](/documentation/appstoreserverapi/look_up_order_id/) endpoint to make
sure you’re taking action on the right purchase. Simply ask the user for the
Order ID included on their email receipt from Apple, then use the endpoint to
confirm the invoice and any associated information — for example, whether the
user has already received a refund for their purchase — or to match the date
and time of the purchase with your records.

#### Tools for families

Apple provides tools to help developers and parents deliver safe experiences
for children. With [Ask to Buy](https://support.apple.com/en-us/105055), kids
can send a request to the family organizer when they want to buy or download a
new app or In-App Purchase. And parents can use Screen Time to prevent
unintentional or unauthorized purchases from the App Store, including In-App
Purchases across all apps.

#### Help from Apple

Apple provides world-class customer support to help efficiently resolve
billing issues. Customers can use [Report a
Problem](https://reportaproblem.apple.com/) at any time to get support for In-
App Purchases made within your app or on the App Store. And because our
support team is located worldwide, we can respond quickly. Customers receive
email receipts from Apple for any purchases they’ve made, and they can view
their purchase history in their Apple Account.

You can [contact us](/contact/) at any time with questions about your Apple
Developer Program membership, App Store Connect, implementing technologies and
features, and more.
