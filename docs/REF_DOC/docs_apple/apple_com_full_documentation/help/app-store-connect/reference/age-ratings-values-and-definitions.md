# Age ratings values and definitions

The _age rating_ is a required [app information](/help/app-store-
connect/reference/app-information) field used for property used by the
parental controls. These controls enable parents and guardians to establish a
safe online environment for children. As a developer, you can deliver age-
appropriate experiences tailored for users across all age groups.

In App Store Connect, you'll find a list of content descriptors, in-app
controls, and capabilities that allow you to specify the frequency or presence
of each in your app. Apple generates appropriate ratings based on your answer
to the age rating questionnaire. [Learn how to set an app age
rating.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/set-an-app-age-rating)
