# Download financial reports

Financial reports show your monthly proceeds, as well as final unit sales by
country or region and order type. They’re automatically generated once a
month, based on Apple’s [fiscal
calendar](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/wa/jumpTo?page=fiscalcalendar),
and are only generated if there are purchases or refunds during that fiscal
period.

Financial reports for the previous fiscal month's earnings are available by
the first Friday of the current fiscal month. You can sign up to receive email
notifications as soon as your financial reports are available each month.
[Learn more.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-team/view-and-edit-your-
profile#set-email-notifications) Financial reports remain available for a
period of ten years from the reporting date.

You can manually download reports from App Store Connect. [Learn how to
download sales and financial reports using the App Store Connect
API.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi)

There are four types of reports available.

## All Countries or Regions (Detailed)

This detailed financial report covers all locations in which you have sales on
the App Store and includes the transaction and settlement dates for purchases.
It’s available once all respective individual currency reports are available,
starting with your March 2020 report.

## All Countries or Regions (Single File)

This consolidated financial report covers all locations in which you have
sales on the App Store, and is based on processed and settled transactions
during the Apple fiscal month. It’s available once all respective individual
currency reports are available, starting with your March 2020 report.

## All Countries or Regions (Multiple Files)

Separate financial reports cover each location in which you have sales on the
App Store and are based on processed and settled transactions during the Apple
fiscal month. If you change the location where your products are available for
sale, the number of reports you receive may increase or decrease accordingly.
The introduction of new currencies for customers on the App Store may lead to
more reports.

## Transaction tax report (Single File)

This summary report covers the sales tax, use tax, goods and services tax, and
other similar taxes applied on your transactions in the US and Canada. The
report is summarized at a tax rate and jurisdiction level, and is available
the first full month after you've [configured your tax category
settings](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/set-a-tax-category/).

### Download and view the transaction tax report from App Store Connect

The monthly transaction tax report shows the sales tax, use tax, goods and
services tax, and other similar taxes that Apple applies to your transactions
in the US and Canada. Apple’s tax calculation service uses multiple inputs to
calculate tax on customer transactions in the jurisdictions where we
administer tax, including your tax category selection in App Store Connect,
app metadata, legal entity status, customer attributes, and other requirements
in accordance with the local laws and regulations.

**Note:** To review input taxes, adjustments, or withholding taxes for a
region, please locate the Taxes and Adjustments field in your [Payments and
Financial
Reports](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/itc/payments_and_financial_reports#/).
These taxes aren’t included in the Transaction tax report.
