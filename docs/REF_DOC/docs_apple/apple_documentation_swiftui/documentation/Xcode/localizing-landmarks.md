## [Overview](/documentation/Xcode/localizing-landmarks#Overview)

This is an unlocalized version of
[Landmarks](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/landmarks-
building-an-app-with-liquid-glass). Prepare it for localization by adding a
String Catalog and import translations (`de.xcloc`) to complete the
localization process.
