## [Overview](/documentation/SwiftUI/building-rich-swiftui-text-
experiences#Overview)

Note

This sample code project is associated with WWDC25 session 280: [Code-along:
Cook up a rich text experience in SwiftUI with
AttributedString](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/280/).

You can follow along with the code written in the WWDC25 session, learning how
to upgrade `TextEditor` to rich text, build custom controls, and constrain the
formatting options the editor provides.

After the code-along, you can learn more about how to persist rich text using
SwiftData, and how to export rich text documents using the `Transferable`
protocol.
