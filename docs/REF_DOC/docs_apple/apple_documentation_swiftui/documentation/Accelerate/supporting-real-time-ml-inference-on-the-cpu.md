[`static func makeContext(options: BNNSGraph.CompileOptions, (inout
BNNSGraph.Builder) -> [any BNNSGraph.TensorDescriptor]) throws ->
BNNSGraph.Context`](/documentation/accelerate/bnnsgraph/makecontext\(options:_:\))

Returns a new context that wraps a graph object that the given closure
defines.

[`struct Builder`](/documentation/accelerate/bnnsgraph/builder)

A structure thats provides a closure you can use to define the arguments and
operations of a BNNS Graph.

[`struct Tensor`](/documentation/accelerate/bnnsgraph/builder/tensor)

A structure that represents an abstract handle to a tensor that you use within
a `BNNSGraph.makeContext` closure.
