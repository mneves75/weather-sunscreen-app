2. **Weather Icon Inconsistencies** - Standardized icon handling using WMO weather codes
3. **Memory Leak Risks** - Fixed timeout chains in SunscreenContext with proper cleanup
4. **Missing Error Boundaries** - Added comprehensive error handling at app level
5. **TypeScript Compilation** - Resolved all type errors in native module interfaces

## 💡 Developer Experience

### New Development Practices

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### For Developers
1. Replace all `console.log/warn/error` with `logger` methods:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   console.log('Data loaded', data);
   
   // After
   import { logger } from './services/loggerService';
   logger.info('Data loaded', { data });
   ```

2. Use React.memo for expensive components:
   ```typescript
   export const WeatherScreen = memo(function WeatherScreen() {
     // Component implementation
   });
   ```

3. Ensure proper cleanup in useEffect hooks:
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     let isMounted = true;
     // Async operations checking isMounted
     return () => { isMounted = false; };
   }, [dependencies]);
   ```
