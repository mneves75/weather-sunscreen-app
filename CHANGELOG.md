## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2025-08-22

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Removed unused navigation route types that caused TypeScript compilation errors
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed weather icon inconsistencies by implementing proper WMO weather code mapping
- **CRITICAL**: Resolved memory leak risks in SunscreenContext with proper timeout cleanup
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed missing icon property in native weather module responses
- Navigation type definitions now properly match actual route implementations
- Weather data now consistently uses standardized icon system across all sources
- useEffect hooks now have proper dependency arrays preventing unnecessary re-renders

### Added

  - Environment-aware logging (development vs production)
  - Structured log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
  - Contextual logging for API calls and user actions
  - Safe production logging that prevents sensitive data exposure
- **Error Boundary Component**: App-level error handling with recovery options
  - Graceful error recovery preventing white screen crashes
  - User-friendly error messages with retry capabilities
  - Development mode debug information display
  - Component stack trace logging for debugging
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Enhanced timeout management in SunscreenContext
  - Proper cleanup with isMounted tracking
  - Bounds checking for timer delays
  - Safe async operation handling
