## Versioning Strategy

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for new functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version for backward compatible bug fixes

Version numbers sync across:
- `package.json`
- `app.json`
- Native iOS/Android configurations
- This CHANGELOG.md

Use `bun run sync-versions` to propagate version updates.

## Maintenance Notes

### Performance Monitoring
- Track iOS build times (target: <15s)
- Monitor app launch time (target: <2s)
- Watch bundle size growth
- Check memory footprint (<100MB target)

### SDK Updates
- Review Expo SDK releases quarterly
- Test beta versions before major upgrades
- Maintain compatibility with iOS 16+ and Android API 29+

### John Carmack Review Standards
- All changes subject to technical review
- Code quality and performance critical
- Attention to detail required
- Clear, maintainable code preferred
