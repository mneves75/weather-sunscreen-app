## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- **Type-Safe Internationalization System** - Production-ready i18n with compile-time validation
  - Created `src/types/i18n.ts` with I18N_KEYS constants and TypeScript union types
  - Type-safe keys prevent typos at compile time: HumidityLevelKey, WindLevelKey, CardinalKey, AdvisoryKey
  - Exhaustive type checking with `as const` assertion on direction arrays
  - All weather utility functions now return typed i18n keys instead of hardcoded strings
  - Refactored getWeatherAdvisory() to return typed advisory keys with consistent pattern
  - Updated components to use t() wrapper for all translatable content

- **Input Validation & Edge Case Handling** - Defensive programming for utility functions
  - getHumidityLevel(): Validates input, clamps to 0-100 range, handles NaN/Infinity with safe defaults
  - getWindDescription(): Validates input, handles invalid values gracefully
  - degreesToCardinal(): Proper degree normalization (handles negative and > 360 values)
  - All functions include console warnings for invalid inputs (debugging assistance)
  - Prevents silent failures and improves code reliability

- **Advisory Translation System** - Localized weather advisories in 2 languages
  - Added weather.advisories section to both en.json and pt-BR.json
  - 5 advisory types: thunderstorm, bringUmbrella, snowConditions, extremeHeat, extremeCold
  - Portuguese translations: "Alerta de tempestade", "Leve um guarda-chuva", etc.
  - Advisory logic: thunderstorm > temperature > precipitation (priority-based)

- **Comprehensive Unit Tests (31 Tests)** - Full coverage for utility functions
  - Boundary condition tests (humidity 0-100, wind 0-200, degrees 0-360)
  - Edge case tests (NaN, Infinity, negative values, out-of-range)
  - Translation file validation (ensures keys exist in both languages)
  - All 31 tests passing with 100% success rate
  - Created `src/utils/__tests__/weather.test.ts` with professional test structure

- **Metro Configuration for Bundling** - Offline iOS builds without Metro dev server
  - Created `metro.config.js` using Expo's getDefaultConfig
  - Enables JavaScript bundling for release builds and CI/CD
  - Supports additional file extensions (cjs, mjs) for compatibility

- **iOS Build Scripts** - Production-ready bundling workflows
  - `scripts/build-ios-bundle.sh` - Metro-based bundle creation for Xcode
  - `scripts/build-ios-bundle-expo.sh` - Expo export method (alternative)

  - Reduced excessive inline documentation from 54 lines → 3 lines header
  - Cleaned up verbose comments in components
  - Maintained code clarity through type safety instead of comments
  - Applied John Carmack standards for pragmatic code

### Changed
- **i18n Architecture Evolution** - Improved naming for nested objects
