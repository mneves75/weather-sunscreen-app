## [2.0.1] - 2025-09-10

### Changed

- Navigation consolidated to Expo Router (file-based) under `app/`; legacy `src/navigation/**` removed.
- LiquidGlassWrapper simplified: removed unused props, memoized optional module load, single clear fallback path.
- PerfStats refactored: FPS via rAF timestamps, TTI via requestIdleCallback (fallback to setTimeout).
- AppProviders now wires both theme providers explicitly; prevents missing context in children.

### Added

- Dev routes for quick visual checks (Expo Router): `(dev)/glass-gallery` and `(dev)/icon-gallery`.
- i18n keys for location fallbacks (`location.unknown`, `location.addressUnavailable`); removed hardcoded strings.
- Tests covering AppProviders theme wiring, forecast mapping, location fallback, PerfStats overlay, and glass wrappers.

### Security/Robustness

- Native test seams in `modules/liquid-glass-native` guarded: no-ops when not in `__DEV__`.
- Jest infra hardened for Expo modules (`expo-image`, `expo-blur`, `expo-linear-gradient`, RNGH) with safe mocks.

### Docs

- README updated: Expo Router structure, dev routes, and clarified build/test guidance.
- Template docs updated to prefer Expo Router; legacy React Navigation snippet kept as reference only.
