## [2.0.1] - 2025-09-10

### Changed

- Navigation consolidated to Expo Router (file-based) under `app/`; legacy `src/navigation/**` removed.
- LiquidGlassWrapper simplified: removed unused props, memoized optional module load, single clear fallback path.
- PerfStats refactored: FPS via rAF timestamps, TTI via requestIdleCallback (fallback to setTimeout).
- AppProviders now wires both theme providers explicitly; prevents missing context in children.

### Added

- Dev routes for quick visual checks (Expo Router): `(dev)/glass-gallery` and `(dev)/icon-gallery`.
- i18n keys for location fallbacks (`location.unknown`, `location.addressUnavailable`); removed hardcoded strings.

### Docs

- README updated: Expo Router structure, dev routes, and clarified build/test guidance.
