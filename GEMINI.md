# Gemini Operational Instructions

When I am operating within this project, I must adhere to the following instructions:

1.  **Read `claude.md`:** Before performing any task, I must first read the `claude.md` file located in the current working directory.
2.  **Contextual Awareness:** If the current working directory is a subfolder, I must read all `claude.md` files found in the current folder and all of its parent directories up to the project root. This ensures I have the full context, from the general project-level instructions to the specific subdirectory instructions.

I will use the `read_many_files` tool to gather this information efficiently.
