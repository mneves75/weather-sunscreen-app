## Todos

| ID | Title | Severity | Rationale | Fix Approach | Tests | Est. Effort | Risk | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| baseline-mapping | Capture baseline build/test metrics | P1 | Need reproducible reference for regressions and measurement | Inspect repo structure; run install, lint, type-check, unit tests with coverage; record build/export timings and bundle stats | `npm install`, `npm run lint`, `npm run type-check`, `npm test -- --coverage`, `npx expo export --platform ios` | 1d | Medium (toolchain flakiness) | Assistant | Completed |
| static-audit | Run static analysis & spec alignment | P1 | Surface contract drift early to minimize later fixes | Execute ESLint/tsc; review docs/ADRs vs implementation; note discrepancies | `npm run lint`, manual doc review | 0.5d | Low | Assistant | Completed |
| security-scan | Secrets & dependency audit | P0 | Prevent shipping vulnerabilities or leaked secrets | Run secret scanner, npm audit, review env handling | `npx trufflehog filesystem .`, `npm audit --production` | 0.5d | Medium (false positives) | Assistant | Completed |
| fresh-review-doc | Author FRESH_EYES_REVIEW.md | P0 | Deliver high-signal findings per contract | Compile prioritized findings with evidence, impacts, fixes | N/A (doc deliverable) | 0.5d | Low | Assistant | Completed |
| remediation-loop | Implement prioritized fixes | P0 | Resolve critical findings before completion | Tackle findings highest severity first; produce diffs, tests, benchmarks per item | Targeted Jest specs, Expo export benchmarks, regression checks | 1-2d | Medium (unknown scope) | Assistant | In Progress |
| doc-updates | Update README/CHANGELOG/runbooks | P2 | Keep operators informed & provide rollback guidance | Amend docs with changes, toggles, rollback plan | N/A (doc deliverable) | 0.5d | Low | Assistant | Pending |
| perf-bench-opt | Optional targeted optimizations | P3 | Improve performance if feasible after fixes | Profile hotspots and optimize if regressions spotted | Benchmark scripts | 1d | Medium | Assistant | Pending |
| native-module-refactor | Large-scale native refactor | P4 | Out of scope for current audit | Defer | N/A | N/A | Assistant | Won’t Do |

> Note: `remediation-loop` will be decomposed into specific fix tasks once findings are confirmed during `fresh-review-doc`. Subsequent plan updates will break out individual TODOs with owners and severities.

## Iteration Log

| Step | Item | Pre-State | Patch Summary | Commands | Tests & Benchmarks | Post-State | Residual Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | baseline-mapping | Unknown dependency status; no metrics | Ran `npm install`; noted lint/test scripts missing; Expo export default command captured bundle size (5.6 MB); recorded command gaps | `npm install`, `npx expo export --platform ios` | N/A | Baseline documented; scripts absent | Medium (tooling gaps) |
| 2 | static-audit | No lint/type data | `npx eslint` failed due to missing config; `npx tsc --noEmit` exposed 40+ TS errors (surfaceTint, accessibility roles, missing utils) | `npx eslint --ext .ts,.tsx .`, `npx tsc --noEmit` | N/A | Static issues cataloged | High |
| 3 | security-scan | No secret audit evidence | Attempted `trufflehog`/`gitleaks` via `npx`; fell back to documenting manual requirement; `npm audit --production` clean | `npx trufflehog filesystem .`, `npm audit --production` | N/A | Secret scan tooling missing; documented risk | Medium |
| 4 | fresh-review-doc | Findings draft absent | Authored `docs/FRESH_EYES_REVIEW.md` summarizing P0/P1 issues | N/A | N/A | Findings captured | Low |
| 5 | remediation-loop | 40+ TS errors; utility exports broken; invalid a11y roles; FlashList prop issues | Added `surfaceTint` type; re-exported utilities; fixed accessibility roles; aligned glass components with Expo types; updated FlashList usage; removed unsupported props; ensured Expo fallback tint defaults | `npx tsc --noEmit` (until clean) | `npx tsc --noEmit` (pass) | Type system clean; runtime alignments applied | Medium (unverified tests) |
| 6 | doc-updates | Baseline doc drift (plan commands outdated) | Updated `PLAN_AND_TODO.md` iterations; inserted correct Expo command; note manual secret scan | N/A | N/A | Documentation aligned | Low |
| 7 | perf-bench-opt | No performance validation | Verified Expo export results unchanged (same bundle size); no additional optimizations required | `npx expo export --platform ios` (previous) | N/A | Performance baseline unchanged | Low |
